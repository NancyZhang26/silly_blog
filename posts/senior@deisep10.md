<h3>Less Than 100 Days Till Graduation</h3>

Today is a hallmark for me - I had at least 5 Fisher DJ dreams stitched together. I woke up feeling like I didn’t need any coffee at all. Yet I still drank up a cup of Caramel salted whatever Starbucks drink in under 5 minutes. But I woke up so fresh. After 4 slices of Pizza and a 12-hour sleep. The new year did me good.

I am a bit dizzy because of the caffeine rush.

Yesterday, while I was watching Avani and Galia play their matches, seeing them try so hard made me want to tear up. 4 years, yet each moment feels so new. I wish I had realized to live in the moments a bit sooner.

4 years really passed like a whim. Sometimes I look back, and I never realized that for so many times my mind was always wandering above the present. Every occasion like this makes me realize I was losing pieces of life. I wish for every instance in front of me, I am 100% all in.

It really is my last year at Cali and my last year doing team-related things together. Probably the last time I do competitive team sport in which everyone is ‘forced’ to be locked in under stress. It’s really not that deep, lads. But it is the beauty of the struggles that makes me feel so human and so real.

…

I guess I spent all of the first day of New Year’s Eve and the New Year's eating junk food, sleeping, cleaning here and there, and being sick. Everything but serious work. And I missed the beach day, so I packed my bikinis for nothing.

Avani is watching the Three-Body movie right now, and I tried to lock back in on my to-dos. I got into masters of Brandeis and ASU, btw. Only if getting a job is that easy! I really do not feel like studying again.

I miss Jiayi, Xinpeng, and a7cher. :,(
