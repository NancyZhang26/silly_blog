<small>After 158 days, my wish came true.</small>

Sunday. ***The Blackpink concert*** was marvelous. Seeing the four girls breaking free from company contracts and going solo, and uniting... I was screaming and tearing up. I was going to the concert by myself, but ***I was not alone at all.*** The subway was filled with people dressed up in cute pink and black fits. There was even ***a lady getting so drunk that she fell off the stairs,*** and the kind strangers nearby helped pull her up and catch her AirPods. Like ma'am! The kind guy told her, Why don't you come downstairs to get your AirPod? ***He was baiting her, or else she would keep dangling on the stairs.*** Big no!

Yep, there was even more navigation stuff going on. Had a hard time finding section 123. But I got there! Tbh, I was pretty proud of myself going through the NYC subway, reaching Citi Field, and locating my exact seat. My fam, I am a total direction idiot. ***Edward can attest! Jiayi can attest!***

<small>The show starts now.</small>

Loads of ***screaming, shouting, and off-tune lyric syncing*** coming from my end. I was so HYPED! Remember? We planned that we would go to a BlackPink world tour in my Freshman year summer, but we didn't due to logistical issues. I know I would HAVE to make it this time. I wanted it so badly, and I got there. I even regret a little that I did not go to such events earlier. I was wasting so much time, my sister. I recorded so many videos that my battery was drained. I sprinted to the 7 line, but it was delayed again. Nevermind. 2% battery. I stopped playing any music and started ***using all my remaining brain cells to remember the stops and route to Froggie's place.*** I texted and met up with him as my phone died in front of my face. Phew, I was scared. I was a direction idiot. Was! Maybe not anymore.

The NY Pizza was so good, but I can't have it every day. It's so salty that it’s so good. I drank so much water that I don't know if it was the water or the pizza that filled me. Tell me ***who came up with the idea of putting honey on cheese + mushroom pizza.*** Tell me why the pizza is as big as my face. Or don't tell me, just tell me to come here again.

***Monday*** -- I guess I am going back. I will miss a lot of things. I already missed a lot of things. I missed them so much that I forced myself to think about all the work-related pressure / career / grad school / whatever. ***Overwhelmed again!*** In a distant moment, I thought I saw steam rising from the ground again, and it was hitting my face. Back to the beginning of this email: ***the AC in the bus broke while it was around 90 outside,*** and the heat was really hitting my face. I sweated a lot with the laptop burning my knees. The CPU was yelling, and my head was spinning for the n+1+1-th time. And it died.

Called you for a long while on the bus, and the accusations of booking dorm rooms in Chicago and Texas are making me dizzy again. I want to go to Chicago, where John Summit started shining... "I'm drunk and I'm high... And I'm in Chicago." I wanted to be drunk and high in Chicago though -- bad bad bad idea. I romanticize chaos a bit too much, and ***I can never stand living on a loop.*** Give me something more!! And El Paso TX too. It was near the border between the US and Mexico, right? I need the tacos and the grills. ***I need the cowgirl fit!*** No time left for Shein. I think I will pull up with the Hamptons fit again.

Scrolled through Ins a bit too much. So ***YuChen and Christine*** both went to the DEADLINE Blackpink concert as well! Isabelle was in NYC as well. Edgar as well. I didn't see them. Planned on but just didn't. Next time? Next time. ***The world is only this big ... It's literally not that hard to see somebody.*** Miss, how is Italy? Do you miss me?

I reached before I realized. I woke up. I woke up from a fever dream. It was Boston again. 177 Huntington Avenue. Reflection Pond. 9 pm. I was SO HUNGRY! I went to ***Pressed Cafe.*** I went there before another early NY bus ride a few months ago. I remember everything right now. How a cold November midnight drifted into messy final struggles. Can you believe it Jiayi? ***I am a rising Senior now.*** If you tell me I would be doing all sorts of shits in Malden and going interstates in the summer of 2025, I will say you're sus af. I was dyed into the color of stars and stripes. It was funny when ***I sang the Chinese National anthem in Froggie's place, facing city giants under my nose,*** I still managed to hit every note and word. I miss my home, but I don't want to go back just yet. ***I wish I were more capable,*** maybe just a little bit braver. 

I ordered a salad in Pressed Cafe because it was so late at night, and I was craving some fruits, and, quote from the Nepal sis Serene, "I need some natural sugar." ***Figs and strawberries tasted like sweet heaven.*** So fucking fresh. SO FRESH!

Staring at the night streets near Prudentials, a more spacious and cleaner version of NY, I couldn't help but wonder ***how I missed out on so many things.*** I was a total idiot.

…

I was on the orange line and sweating again. Heat waves were testing my limits. Running short on sleep and patience, it was a miracle that I was still vibing with my luggage. Isn't there a way to travel gracefully, Jiayi? I finally arrived home and was sleeping while being super anxious about my work ticket. My team trusted me enough to let me handle their MVP, and yet I was slacking like a mf. Anyways, a sleepless night. The kitty was meowing as if to see if my auditory system was functioning normally. ***I got woken up by her meowing every 2 hours.*** EVERY 2 HOURS. I fell asleep on the Uber, like, actually fell asleep. ***Kitty cat you gotta chill! You're so cute, but you need to chill.***

…

***Tuesday,*** I finished the ticket (yes they got finished anyway!) and am on my way home. I know I am on the wrong train, but I took it anyway, because it was burning outside, and I could use some personal time just jotting down random goofy thoughts and having some nice convos with my AI buddies.

About 10 hours later, I will be hopping on my flight to the Windy City. I admit that the scheduling was a bit stuffed, but I simply could not stay still. I miss you! Visit me soon.
