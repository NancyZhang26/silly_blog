<h3>Main Plots Start Here</h3>

I hope everyone becomes a billionaire.

Context: The company had an “All Hands: Beer with the Boss” event in a place called Treehouse.

The email said, “All work should be done by 3 pm… I hope to see everyone there ***<u>with a drink,***</u> or ***<u>waiting for a drink…”***</u>

<h3>Tom in a Corner</h3>

***<u>Happy Birthday Emma!***</u>

Emma drove Chirag and me to the Treehouse. Big club space! I suddenly felt rich. It was very Gatsby. Emma laughed out loud when I said “Gatsby.”

<small>View from the Treehouse balcony. Is it giving Gatsby?</small>

Emma gave me ***<u>2 extra beer tickets***</u> because she was driving. Thank you Emma!

We wandered around doing nothing. This one dude on the golf field will never know that he was eyed by 5 innocent interns. ***<u>The vodka Seltzer tastes just like sugary water.***</u> Boring.

<small>Boring.</small>

The CEO started an enthusiastic speech!

The interns were all standing in a corner beside the stove, eyeing the CEO through the shoulders of a mid-size crowd.

An old guy, ***<u>Tom,***</u> squeezed into the corner. He’s got snow-white hair and a mildly hoarse voice. I introduced myself and offered a handshake. He said, ***<u>oh… my hands are greasy… Let’s just do an air handshake.***</u> So we did an air handshake. (???)

We started a conversation about… ***<u>dogs.***</u> I told him I have a dog in China. He told me he always wanted a small poodle, but his landlord won’t allow him. He was living in the same house with his landlord for over 25 years. At this point, is he still a landlord?

All the interns were standing like trees in a forest, but Tom was sitting down like a tree stump. He told me that he wants to be in a position where ***<u>he can see others, but others cannot see him.***</u>

In this perfectly safe corner that he found, ***<u>Tom’s head almost dropped between his knees.***</u> He was ***<u>dozing off***</u> when the CEO said that our company is slaying faster than ever.

I was standing for 1.5 hours.

A spider was crawling on Liam’s back.

<h3>I Made Friends/Connections</h3>

50% of the crowd dipped right away after the CEO’s speech. Emma was gone within a blink. Tom disappeared ***<u>faster than my self-esteem.***</u> I stuck around with Chirag, just talking, munching pizza, and sipping on sugary water.

We talked quite a lot about Masters, Asian systems, shares, future life… Chirag seems very enthusiastic about planning out a good life, regardless of it being late-night library sessions in college, or a regular 9-5 in an office. He is 3 years older than me, and I think he’s got his shit figured out. I gained quite some insights from him. We even ***<u>developed a handshake?!***</u>

Chirag’s birthday is on ***<u>3/9!***</u> Holy god. I instantly developed ***<u>a master plan:***</u> the party starts with a tequila shot on ***<u>Bhakti’s birthday (3/8),***</u> peaks for ***<u>3 consecutive midnights,***</u> and closes with some ***<u>high-class champagne on Chahana’s big day (3/12).***</u>

One of the best things I learned from this internship: ***<u>I got to talk to so many people who are older, wiser, and smarter than me.***</u> Every day, I learned something new about not only CS but also the industry trends, US culture, and just life in general. I am truly, truly grateful.

Before leaving Treehouse, I connected with a colleague, Z. ***<u>Z is from Shanghai too!***</u> He started talking to me directly in Shanghainese… I stuttered, and he immediately bantered that I am a ***<u>洋泾浜 (speaks bad Shanghainese).***</u> We added each other’s ***<u>WeChat.***</u> Not Slack or iMessage or WhatsApp. ***<u>WeChat!***</u> I am crying after that little green icon. It really felt heart-warming connecting with a homie, who, according to his ***<u>WeChat posts***</u>, is lecturing in some schools about ***<u>Machine Learning?!***</u> Hello?! Professor Cashman, are you proud of me?

<h3>Touch Some Fish</h3>

The next day, I was trying to pretend as if I were working while ***<u>“multitasking”***</u> — talking to Z on WeChat. I asked him, how did you know I am from Shanghai too? He said, it’s on your LinkedIn!

My LinkedIn?! No, please don’t expose ***<u>my most hypocritical social media account.***</u>

I need to quote from this dude:

>Me: I did all my work on the Juneteenth Holiday, so I could chill in the office the day after.

>Z: Classic ***<u>码农(Coding Peasants)***</u> behavior.

…

>Me: 50/50 applications went into dead ends.

>Z: ***<u>It’s their loss!***</u>

>Me: Nah, I know where I am at.

>Z: You’ve got some ***<u>fake humbleness.***</u> Classic Shanghainese.

>Me: No I sleep in all my classes.

>Z: At least you go to classes.

>Me: AI does all my work.

>Z: ChatGPT should get your degree then.

>Me: No, I was simply ***<u>training LLM.***</u> I was sacrificing my own learning curve for a better model, aka ***<u>benefiting the human race.***</u>

…

>Me: Why did you come to this company?

>Z: ***<u>The VP sold me some dreams.***</u>

<small>Is that even sayable...</small>

…

>Z: You guys are on summer holidays, right? I would be jealous, but less jealous seeing y'all being here.

>Me: Lol, I got my first internship quite late. Should have done more things in Sophomore year.

>Z: Enjoy the holidays while you can!

>Me: Might as well just go lie in my parents’ bank accounts, aka, ***<u>take a few gap years.***</u>

>Z: ***<u>GAP year - Getting Allowances from Parents.***</u>

It hits differently when cracking BS jokes ***<u>in my mother tongue.***</u> Jiayi, I am sure you can relate. I was laughing in silent mode, or should I say vibration mode. Emma's desk was on my left. At this point, I think we are good pals with some tacit understandings: if one of us started doing something weird… Just let it be…
