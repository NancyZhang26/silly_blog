Dear Jiayi,

How's Italy? I hope Rome and Venice are treating you well, honey.

I forgot to buy the shirt that says ***”I Survived My Trip to NYC.”*** I did survive! 5-6 times. What is it with NYC and Boston? Somehow, I always find a way to travel in between. I am on the bus ***BACK TO Boston*** right now. The buses, oh my god. ***I was drenched in sweat again.*** The AC was unstable, and I was stuck inside seats like sardines. Holding this gigantic company laptop feels like juggling glass balls, and I couldn't help but stare at ***the phone screen of the passenger in front of me.***

I think I ate quite a lot of salty stuff yesterday. Man, that ***ramen place*** Froggies brought me was ***a taste-bud changer,*** and tell me about an authentic slice of NYC pizza please. I don't think my stomach processed them too well. I was ***chugging water like shots,*** and the rings were stuck on my finger right now. This is how bloated I am. The Kate Spade ring was peeling off again. My goodness! I still have the ***Blackpink concert*** echo in my head. New York was so ***overwhelming.*** Everything was happening. It was so hot that I could see white steam rising from the ground. The bus is ***suspiciously shaky*** right now, so are my head and hands. Every inch of direct contact between my skin and the nylon seat cover is so irritating. I need a shower so bad.

The trip ***TO NYC*** was equally chaotic. I had 2 overpriced but very delicious sandwiches outside of Northeastern, near the reflection pond. I quickly met up with Chirag. Quick chat, quick goodbye, and he headed off to his Northeastern job. I was in line with crowds of other passengers with differently sized bags. Yep, ***I canNOT survive a plain 5-hour ride.*** SORRY! I took an eddie like a champ. Raspberry flavor. I couldn't taste the THC at all. ***It started hitting me.*** My surroundings started drifting away. And guess what, ***the bus was delayed for 1.5 hours!*** Yo. What could I do? I sit outside the reflection pond. Another round of crowd watching. The gum was hitting me with wave after waves. I was watching kids again, but under a different context, and hopefully a righteous one.

***Exactly 1.5 hours later, I made it!*** I followed my alarm and got to the bus, but couldn't catch the best seats, so I was stuck inside the rear with ***another girl who called me babes on the first try.*** Girl, I was stuffed like a can of capitalized goods. But I made it. When Froggie called me 10 minutes before we landed, ***I was sobering up*** - from both the drenched sleep and the gummy. I couldn't see a single thing on the screen cuz my background was all back! I want to see you so badly. Miss you boo.

<small>Getting ready for my fam.</small>

Your call woke me up at ***9 am*** after this shit. GURL. I fell back into bed again. Woke up at 12. Make up, fits... It feels good to walk barefoot on the ground without cat litter. Thank you, XP. I headed to New Yorkers and met up with ***Edward and Serene.*** Why is the executive room so small? Rounds of soju and shots. ***They must have gone bad.*** After 2 hours of navigating the NY subway, ***carried by Edward,*** and a cookie and a cup of cold brew, ***I just need to pull the trig*** after arriving at Corona Park. The Park was deadass so big by the way. The crowd was wild. I mean, ravers, what could you ***not*** experience? Ravers! We are afraid of nothing.

<small>Corona Park was MASSIVE.</small>

Anyways, ***I threw up big time in the portable potty.*** Oh lord does my breath stink. Luckily, I carried all the sanitizing goods. I chewed so much gum and put on so much perfume. The rave was good. I was not super familiar with Keinemusik, but the vibe checks. The beat drop and groove management were top-tier. They played their most famous [Say What](https://open.spotify.com/track/2GwsSbo6IbNDVvcm9rtmal?si=851d2ffcedee41a1) and [Move](https://open.spotify.com/track/1BJJbSX6muJVF2AK7uH1x4?si=f7edb784d1c649d0) at the end. I mean, of course. Before that, we again did a bunch of ***crowd searching*** and ***crowd penetrating.*** Not very graceful! I needed to throw up for the second time, and I threw up straight water and any lingering alcohol. What was going on. ***What was going on.*** But when those German DJs played Move and Say What, we all went nuts. Serene was so pretty. Girl's got eye makeup and ponytails like Ariana Grande. Gorgeous.

<small>We are at Corona Park!</small>

On our way back, the train went out of service. We had to Uber to the A line and continue from there. What is wrong with NYC Uber and NYC subways and NYC transportation! We were cursing. The stranger lady beside us was cursing. Some strange strangers were cursing as well. Edward and Serene's phone died, and I am the most unreliable navigator! ***Every time I come to NY, there is so much walking.*** So much! The big apple was so friendly. I could really eat an apple right now. I mean it. I am so thirsty I could use some vitamins.

The Riff Raff bar was quite chill. I gotta say the drinks are a little mid, but the aesthetics though? ***We three 20-something kids sit in there like some high-class business people, and NO ONE CHECKED OUR ID.*** Is this what NY is like? If it is, I love it. 

A photographer came over and took our pictures, and another event marketing person came just to talk to us for a bit. Of course, I need to promote my DJ business. God forbid I actually said -- ***“I am just starting my business, so I basically charge little to none lmfao.”*** But I did send it, and he liked the message.

I was walking in the high heels I borrowed from Serene. Every step made a statement, and ***I felt like [Carrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Bradshaw) in Sex and the City.*** It was these kinds of moments that made me believe I will end up in a big city like New York, or actually New York! Regardless of the smell of weed and piss. I mean, ***who doesn't take a pill, and who doesn't take a piss.***

I power-walked to Froggie's apartment after saying goodbye to Edward and Serene. I missed him again at the entrance! Just like how I missed him in front of Club Cafe. I walked past the hotel and came back and realized I went too far -- anyways, ***I saw Froggie again!*** It was just a week since I last saw him, but I missed him so much, and the shots I took made me miss him even more. 

The ***million-dollar night view*** from his apartment was marvelous. I promise right here, I will work very hard to afford something like that on my own. Not my parents, not my sister, on my own. Cringe!!! But I want to become a big city girl to own an apartment by myself and have a view like this. ***Morning views with yellow taxis moving like Lego pieces, and night views with blinding neon lights and night seekers moving in far distances like armies of ants.*** I will do it.

<small>I did not find the night view photo, but this is the day-time view woo-hoo.</small>

Did we go to bed by 3 or 4 am? The city was waking up in front of us. The sun was not fully up yet, but the shades were going away. Froggie pulled down the curtains. ***In my dream, someone popped a really great joke, and we were laughing as if there was no tomorrow.***

...TBC.
