<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

Finished this piece a while ago, but took me a moment to post it here.

<h3>Never Felt Like This Before</h3>

The first 2 months of junior year were desperate but still manageable. Pauri said I ‚Äúfinished my season strong.‚Äù I was so motivated. I kept thinking that I only have 2 years left. Better make them count.

Then I ***<u>broke up with that guy <a href="{{ '/posts/hotgrillep2/' | url }}">(recap)</a> after some ridiculous arguments***</u> (Let‚Äôs just call it a breakup, although we were never really together). It was ***<u>the same day as my COSI 21A Data Structure midterm.***</u> I was lying face down on my bed, sobbing. I knew this was coming. ***<u>Never felt this helpless before.***</u> The world was spinning again until the end of my midterm. I walked out in disgrace.

Mandy welcomed me with a dazzling smile and a warm invitation to Mulan, the Taiwanese restaurant near campus, which I had to decline. I tried putting on my most decent face. The minute we said goodbye, I silently burst into tears.

Got too tired of crying, I went into ***<u>Schwartz 112,***</u> the classroom of COSI 10A, where we officially started talking like two decent students, although we literally ***<u>just played rage cage last weekend, and I chugged the bitch cup right beside him.***</u>

I leaned back, put on my headphones, and started banging Chappell‚Äôs [‚ÄúGood Luck, Babe!‚Äù](https://open.spotify.com/track/0WbMK4wrZ1wFSty9F7FCgu?si=3bac715eff374280) so many times because I could really use some good luck. Another song I put on repeat was [‚ÄúAPT.‚Äù](https://open.spotify.com/track/5vNRhkKd0yEAg8suGBpjeY?si=d34c2583a26d4a25) by Mars and Ros√©. No reason. I just love the melodies.

Cheerful songs, beautiful voices, yet I still detected some sorrow inside them. Detected or reflected? I played them on phone on speakers and on headphones like national anthems.

And the clock started rewinding. The empty lecture hall was suddenly full of people and a shy [Delfino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-delfino-b274135/). It took me back to ***<u>1 year ago***</u> when I was putting my number in his phone, and he texted me the most random things. I laughed like a little girl. In Ridgewood B 304, I was playing ["Can't Stop Falling In Love"](https://open.spotify.com/track/44AyOl4qVkzS48vBsbNXaC?si=c494de0c41de48bc) on my guitar, and he was gazing at me as if he meant it.

As if he meant it.

Talking about it now really makes me nostalgic for the early college years when I was still living with the enthusiasm of a high schooler, meeting new people in raw dorms and frat parties. I still like those parties because ***<u>seeing my friends or even distant acquaintances tripping like drunk mfs amuses me too much.***</u> But somehow the only drunk mf was me.

</h3>

Dunno how it turned into an ex story but whatevs! I need to write it down. My blog my rules. (:P)

I went back from Schwartz to Ziv 128. The first thing I did ‚Äî without a doubt ‚Äî breathe in and out, ***<u>on repeat.***</u> Again, and again, and again. ***<u>I was so dizzy.***</u> So dizzy. Because I inhaled too much nicotine at once. This Geek Bar brand even has a screen that displays animations of zodiac signs‚Ä¶ Crazy. I was face down on my bed again, ***<u>immobilized by the sudden nic rush.***</u>

I hope it could ease the pain. It did temporarily because ***<u>it wiped out everything at once.***</u>

Of course I got high too.

Of course it was on repeat ***<u>again, again, and again.***</u> For a long long while.

<h3>I Wanna Puke</h3>

The rest was expected. Finished the semester with a solid 3.6, the lowest GPA I have ever gotten. I was so bitter. I could have done better. I could have spent more effort in 21A and 29B, but it's whatever.

Fast forward to the Spring semester. ***<u>Nobody told me Junior Spring would slap me this hard.***</u>

I was holding off on vaping when I was in China for winter break, but now I was like an unleashed horse.

It was a mixed 4 months. I was studying a lot, training a lot, DJing a lot‚Ä¶ But it was not enough. ***<u>Nothing was enough when I had this adult pacifier.***</u> When I was upset, take a puff. When I was thrilled, take a puff. When I was drunk, take a puff. When I was high, take a puff‚Ä¶

Whenever‚Ä¶ just take a puff.

Whenever WTEN needs to travel, I would become scared of those nic-free periods. I don‚Äôt know if I would become cranky. I still didn‚Äôt identify myself as an addict. Looking back, I really was.

You fucked up bro.

***<u>I knew I fucked up.***</u> My concentration period was like a 3-year-old. I cramped in a match for the first time in my life. I also had something like a panic attack in my class for the first time ever. I blamed it solely on my school life, but who the fuck was I fooling? ***<u>Nothing was working.***</u> NOTHING. Drinking stopped working. Getting high stopped working. Sleeping stopped working. ***<u>Even vaping itself stopped working.***</u> When my friends and I took the same dose of Zyn, they would get dizzy and nauseous while I only enjoyed a light buzz. Everytime I crawled back to my room just to suck on some nic juice and spilled out fruit-flavored mist, I loathe myself.

I thought vaping would make me independent, as in I don‚Äôt need to rely on a person for safety, because substance was such a submissive consolation. Sure it gave me euphoric moments of inspo & did pull me away from people‚Ä¶ ***<u>BY FORCING A FIXATION.***</u> By jailing me with nicotine.

***<u>Now it was just me and nic,***</u> and nothing else, not even emotions and the most basic motivations for life. I thought I could never be cheered up anymore, never look forward to anything anymore. I thought I was broken.

And I took a puff again. That overloading nicotine ***<u>almost made me puke.***</u>

<h3>I Was So Tired</h3>

Do you know that you are a thief? Lifeless but stealing the real life from me. It is amazing how people came up with so many products and pouches for you. ***<u>It is amazing how I fell into them.***</u>

‚ÄúEyes are constantly red.‚Äù I lied. It was because of drugs, and I knew it.

I am tired. ***<u>I am so tired.***</u> So tired of relying on substance to type, to code, to journal, to become a so-called normal person. So tired of losing interest in everything, feeling like I could not laugh from heart anymore. So tired of being a kid, faking some pain that I induced to myself. So tired of playing damsel in distress and dreaming of saviors. ***<u>The highs are lower, and the lows are lower into the crust.***</u> My skin was like the surface of Mars. My head was constantly aching. Insomnia. 4 am and the cold wind sneaked in through the window crevice. I was lying in my bed sucking in the fiend that froze me even more. I was so stupid. I am so mad right now, thinking about how stupid I was to imagine that a substance would free me from people. It did though, by distancing me from everything else, ***<u>freeing me from an obsession by introducing me to another.***</u> Fuck you, nicotine. Honestly, fuck you.

For so many times, I made up my mind to quit ‚Äúafter this one,‚Äù yet I always have an emergency vape lying in my drawer.

***<u>Ironical and hypocritical.***</u> Why would a man in jail have a gun. Why would I need a vape if I wanna quit.

I wanna be free. For real this time. ***<u>I wanna be truly free.***</u> I wanna feel everything again, ***<u>without nicotine.***</u>

I remember that a long time ago, when I laugh I laugh like a crazy bitch; when I eat I don‚Äôt get disgusted by the minty flavor left on my lips. Every moment dived deep - even the worst was not disguised. They ripped me open, but ***<u>they were real.***</u>

I know they can come back to me.

Don‚Äôt remember the last time I vaped. It was recent. But I don‚Äôt want to make it a ceremony by over-emphasizing the last puff.

Went for a run yesterday, and my lungs felt like they‚Äôre flipped inside out.

It felt so damn good.
