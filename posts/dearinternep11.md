<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Always do things that make you uncomfortable.

<h3>Got the Job</h3>

I was hesitating loads when seeing the executive secretary putting the company party date on the Google calendar. I want to volunteer, just for the experience. But what if I make a fool out of myself and act super awkward?

Worst case, I leave after 3 weeks and leave no trace. So what? ***Stop being a coward!***

I reached out to Jocelyn, and she confirmed that I would be the DJ. So, I guess I am the DJ for Seurat’s 10-year-old Birthday Party!

<h3>Warm Up</h3>

I spent almost 5 hours crafting a chill House list. But it turned out that ***the occasion of this company party was demanding party hits and crowd pleasers.*** Still, I like this chill house set loads. I am glad I started practicing DJ again. After all the rave experiences, I see transitions differently now. Bedroom DJ is such a classic.

Fast forwarding to the party. I played the chill House set as an opener warm-up set. It was just me and some dudes who set up tables and drinks in the car park. ***Very chill.*** Excuse me for my limited vocabulary. I really couldn’t think of any other adjectives other than “chill.”

<h3>Main Scene</h3>

The crowd was arriving. People were grooving and dancing. I was so happy — I missed my AEPi gigs. ***There was something about hearing your set arrangements coming out of the speakers and being distributed onto every corner of the venue (in this case, it was a car park).*** Very exciting!

I got to talk to many full-time people in Seurat as they passed by the DJ table. I got to know their names and just socialized for a bit.

The VP came over and took a picture of me and his two lady guests (either his wife or some family members). He asked, ***Is that what u do aside from engineering?***

>I guess haha…

I also got to talk to the CEO as I handed him the mic and adjusted the volume. ***I want to make sure to let the people at the manager level all remember my face and name.*** Later in my internship timeline, I realized that many of those people I interacted with are important team leaders. They have a completely different professional look inside the office. Scary.

One of the funniest scenes was when Emma’s manager / mentor asked me, ***Can he observe how I DJ?*** I was like, sure, but I just twist buttons once in like forever. I was so awkward that I said…

>Do you club?

Oh man. He laughed. It was ***a rich laugh — from the chest!*** He said he used to, just not anymore. He’s also got that professional look in the office, which intimidates me. That’s why I really don’t know how to handle a daily conversation with him. I just remember when I first met him, he had some thoughts on Python. But I am definitely not talking about Python with him now.

<h3>Too Young</h3>

This one is a real joke. I was talking with my Chinese homie Zee, a coworker here who is also from Shanghai. We were having conversations left and right. He also DJs! Sick.

Later, Zee told me that the VP, seeing us bonding, said:

>She is too young for you.

***Drop dead*** for both of us.

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

The party ended, and one of the workers managing the beer supplies asked if I specialized in the House genre that I played during the pre-party. I said, hell yeah!

He then recommended some Boston House festivals that have good vibes. ***It is cool to talk to new people.*** I never knew what interesting things they could share. New information every day! I hope I don’t sound like a huge dork. Peace out :))
