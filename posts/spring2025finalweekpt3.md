<h3>Main Plots Starts Here:</h3>

12:53 AM, and I couldn’t sleep.

It was too quiet without hearing Becca and Mandy laughing in the aisle, Isabelle randomly ranting in Chinese, Johnny locking his door, and the drunk kids coming back from the frat.

<h3>Packing ver.1: List 'em</h3>

***<u>When I realized that I would have to step over something to reach my bed, I immediately knew that something was inherently wrong.***</u>

It was after giving some old jewelry to Kelsey — I dumped all my sh*ts on the floor, ***<u>and suddenly, there was no floor.***</u>

<small>Floor??</small>

Time to say farewell to the stuff that I:
1. Like but have never used
2. Never used
3. Used but occupies space
4. Used but looks ugly
5. Prolly worth a few bucks on Depop
6. ……
7. %^&*/*&^&* Just everything (no!).

The next thing I knew, I was sitting on piles of trash, underwear, slutty dresses, makeup, DJ deck, food debris, and paper boxes. ***<u>Never have I ever felt so helpless with packing.***</u> 

But I started packing anyway, because ***<u>Chinese women never give up.***</u>

一生不服输的中国女人。

<h3>Packing ver.2: Blood in Gosman</h3>

I went to Gosman to grab my sh*ts, only to see some slimy red liquid on the top of my locker. Apparently one of my shampoo bottles spilled out of nowhere. 

![Spilled shampoo in bag](/img/blog3.0/shampoo-in-bag.jpeg)
<small>Looks like jam!</small>

I couldn’t do anything other than wash the sticky bottles and ***<u>clog 2 Gosman sinks.***</u> Got tired of saying sorry, so I dipped right away.

<small>First sink, clogged</small>

![Clogged 2nd sink](/img/blog3.0/clog-first.jpg)
<small>Second sink, clogged</small>

I don’t wanna spend one more second here.

<small>Felt like Lady Macbeth for a second.</small>

(Fun fact: the ***<u>BRANDEIS POLICE***</u> called me because I left my wallet in the parking lot in front of the health center after donating some medical stuff there. I guess karma was on my side?)

<h3>Packing ver.3: Trip with Phoebe</h3>

After a few days of packing and staring at my tributes from year 3, I shamelessly asked if Phoebe could help drive me to Buffalo Exchange in Somerville. Bunny agreed without even blinking.

<small>Who doesn't love a bunny?</small>

It was pouring as if God was unleashing some wrath — not at me please. I am just a girl. After some traffic and some parking adventures, we entered the store. When going through my stuff, ***<u>I couldn’t tell if the cashier was judging my collection or my personality.***</u>

A whole suitcase of clothes and jewelry. Sold in ***<u>20 bucks.***</u> Didn't know if I should laugh or cry.

I bought a T-shirt that says ***<u>“show me some trash”,***</u> with a raccoon (sorry Anastasia) sitting on Aladdin’s carpet. That was my silent protest to this thrift store. I dumped the unsold stuff in Goodwill next door. That was my karma of the day.

<small>I have to show you some trash!</small>

…

<small>Rushing in Goodwill. Call me a sister!</small>

***<u>The commuter rail was leaving in 5 minutes!***</u> Phoebe and I were rushing in the rain. ***<u>Phoebe was cooking fast-and-furious, and I was playing a crappy cheerleader.***</u> Arriving at Porter Station, I sprinted in the rain with my Lulu shoulder bag running off my left shoulder and the empty suitcase carried weirdly with my right elbow. ***<u>I stepped onto the escalator when the train was choo-chooing, and secured a seat by the window 20 seconds later.***</u>

Raindrops were sliding down my bangs. My Cigarette-After-Sex hoodie was all wet too. It was ironic that I neither had a cigarette nor sex (in a while). I breathed heavily, leaving a small mist on the window. 

Thanks Phoebe bunny bean.

<h3>Packing ver.4: Nathan Rd, and Back at It</h3>

***<u>I used every ounce of Physics knowledge and willpower to cram my entire year into 6 fragile Storage Squad boxes.***</u> How can SS call these “Mega Boxes”?? ***<u>The only thing “Mega” is their imagination, and my desperation.***</u> Every time I sit on (ride) a box and tape it, the tape makes a scratching noise. I think it was its way of complaining about my violent manners.

Yes, I ride that thing like a wild bi*ch (bye).

But ***<u>done.***</u> My 3rd year, boxed.

![6 Mega Boxes](/img/blog3.0/ss-boxes.jpg)
<small>Are they MEGA?</small>

Shifting gears to Nathan Road (Qiyuan's house & Xinpeng's old house). After almost barging into the Baseball bro’s room because I thought it was the basement, I managed to line up some of my summer necessities in Qiyuan’s garage with a little help from the Uber driver. Of course, ***<u>I generously offered a one-dollar tip.***</u>

![QY's garage.](/img/blog3.0/qy-garage.jpg)
<small>Idk which door leads to the garage. I got lucky.</small>

Back at it. Other than 6 MEGA-but-not-so-mega boxes stacking in my room and a sheet-less bed with a pillow and blankets, stolen from the living room, which god knows how many people have used, ***<u>everything else was gone***</u> — my Chinese flag was gone; Alo jacket was gone; mic was gone; sound card was gone; cables were gone; Kate Spade was gone; Channel was gone; Nike was gone; Timb boots were gone; empty alc bottles were gone; notebooks were gone; beddings were gone…

***<u>My junior year was gone.***</u>

It was 1:40 am, 5/14. The last day of finals, and 4 hours before I depart.

<h3>Packing ver.4: A Ziv 128 Production</h3>

My junior year…

The film camera started clicking and rolling. I suddenly started having ***<u>flashbacks of everything that had happened in Ziv 128, room 504A.***</u> The crappy songs I made and rapped over, the DJ sets I weaved, the videos that I edited, the Programming Assignments I did, all the BS I scribbled with AI…

The late-night conversations with Jiayi & ChatGPT, the hallucinations right before I fall asleep, the random wake-up at 6 am, thirst in the morning — my throat feels like sandpaper, the hollow evenings when I woke up from a 2-hour nap…

The tears I shed, curse words I misused, illegal jokes I spitted…

So many nights, coming back drunk from the frat or the city, or exhausted after a Monday TAMID meeting at 10pm; early mornings, getting ready for the lift, or my 8 am Software Engineering class, tucking up my stuffed dinosaur (Rolex) before leaving my room.

It was a sleepless night again, but ***<u>I genuinely don’t know why I couldn’t start dreaming.***</u>

I guess I know. I told everybody that I have stopped missing Brandeis during holidays and breaks because most of my dear ones have either transferred, graduated, or simply left campus. But who am I fooling? ***<u>I will forever miss this slum.***</u> I (think) I grew a lot ever since 08/25/2022, and regardless of where I live or how I lived, Deis was always here, looking poor or holding back on US News ranking, but staying with me in every second.

I still have a year, but ***<u>I can already feel it slipping through my fingertips.***</u>

<h3>Packing ver.5: See You Next Fall</h3>

…Did I even sleep.

The sun rose. I looked through my window for one last time, seeing the cold wooden furniture in rooms of other buildings below my floor. 

![Last view](/img/blog3.0/last-view-at-ziv.jpg)
<small>I insist that it is the best dorm view in the ziv quad.</small>

Now my room is just full of cold wooden furniture too.

***<u>As if nobody was ever here.***</u>
