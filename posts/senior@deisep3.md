<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

The train is spearheading through some tunnel, and I realized that my isolated month is over. I really want to thank Frog and Jiayi a lot. Ngl it’s really on me that I wasn’t staying in touch with many of my other friends. I was only talking to the Frog and Jiayi. That’s kind of all. They supported me through this tough time. I mean I know it is certainly not over at all, but who knows.

<h3>Dream</h3>

Yesterday I had a dream about Danielle emailing me about how I was on a hot debate but eventually got accepted -- among the 4/11 candidates. And thus ends my LC grind. It was an ok dream.

Actually let’s just not talk about the CS stuff. I want to ask who I really am. Cringe. One month of tennis-less nothing-less life is making me feel like I am not the same person anymore, losing all my edges. I know it’s for the best but I don’t like that. I feel like I have become soft, starting with the terrible sleep schedule and doom scrolling behavior. I know I should be all-in on planning on the after-grad things, but I could not stop thinking about the monotonous life I have rn.

I am just asking for drama or more things to write about and I know it. I always romanticize trouble and I wonder what good does it do me. I feel like I have a lot to write down at this particular moment but just couldn’t come up with anything.

25 kids in suit and ties got on the same train and I wonder if they were from a mock trial or some other business trips. The scenaries outside the window look like Maine, reminding of one of the BWT trips we had for ITAs. No more ITAs for me! Sprinting towards the end I guess. Now I really don’t understand why I couldn’t stay still. Outside of the team I would miss the team, but inside the team I was always distracted. None of this makes sense! I don’t like that when I am writing I start thinking about how it reflects me. I always say I’m scared to be read like a book but here I am literally wrting the book out.

I should be studying networking right now, but my head is really aching. Caffine-less for 2 days? I had too much sugary toppings before and I’d say I would run into Einstein with my arms open. Give me back my Americano. Iced.
