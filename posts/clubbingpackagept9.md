<h3>Last Clubbing Post:</h3>
<a href="{{ '/posts/clubbingpackagept8/' | url }}">Clubbing Package Pt.8. A Sailboat Club Is Still a Club</a>

<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Dipped right out of work at 4:30. Reached home at 5:00. Pet the kitty at 5:01. Left at 6:00. Stuck on the road for 50 minutes. Got off ***in the middle of the road and sprinted through the crossings into the dock.***

Everything was streamlined, thanks to the ***shot*** I took before I left. I was ***counting time by feeling how it hit me and left me,*** and that‚Äôs when I quickly took another before I got on the cruise. I was going to ***hide it in my shoe,*** but figured I might as well just drink.

2 shots.

I really hate bad traffic!

<h3>Opener Set</h3>

There are fewer people here for San Pacho than for D.O.D. and Goldfish. I accidentally bought another drink. 3 shots. I was vibing with the opener DJ, a blonde who clearly loves what she was doing.

She played FISHER‚Äôs [It‚Äôs a Killa](https://open.spotify.com/track/2KjQ5zpQGCXgAPbwyPBVqx?si=877fa1212a1e423f), [Toxic](https://open.spotify.com/track/6I9VzXrHxO9rA9A5euc8Ak?si=aa9de4ed499f41b5) remix, [The Real Skim Shady](https://open.spotify.com/track/2WXUcFnJPPATncUkPYC54v?si=19ef760066a24cb4) remix, [Shake That](https://open.spotify.com/track/0fGh0trRN1xz3s41r7V5ce?si=71bd3524209547e6) remix, [Say What](https://open.spotify.com/track/2GwsSbo6IbNDVvcm9rtmal?si=dd3fb84377344ec0) remix. Then there entered a bass line that sounds like [Stephanie](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sh2q76qsc7yLkQNmHKfQf?si=90bdd9a8a72e4c49), but was not Stephanie. She ended her set with [Like I Like It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6vLKVWEuOCQAWEaHv2yknm?si=f7613048235d409c) by Mau P! No words. You go girl.

<h3>San Pacho, Latino House</h3>

There was [San Pacho](https://sanpachomusic.com) with a scarf around his neck, casually chewing gum on the stage, looking just like his Instagram ads. The crowd started surging.

He seamlessly transitioned from [Like I Like It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6vLKVWEuOCQAWEaHv2yknm?si=f7613048235d409c) with his master work [Born Funky](https://open.spotify.com/track/3NR678vn8CA4WtNfujey2W?si=d0f30d45ba514a57). I call it Latino House because the horns are ***so seductive*** just like those Latino ladies.

It turns out those DJs all played something similar at some point.

[Anaconda](https://open.spotify.com/track/794F99D5BQHS5ZGRXAs7I5?si=5e07e16641fc4547) remix, [SexyBack](https://open.spotify.com/track/0O45fw2L5vsWpdsOdXwNAR?si=092d29f04c8a4234) remix, [Meet Her at the Love Parade](https://open.spotify.com/track/3z5fPVImx59TSttFEDZbFJ?si=9dd87e6aba7149ba), [FLY remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/40TX6kbIsqFfUggyMR3zUW?si=9677ff287a8a4d83)...

3/3 cruise parties I went to, either the opener DJ or the main DJ played Messy remix. Idk somehow it‚Äôs just that popular‚Ä¶!

Goodies. When I listened to this track in Fisher‚Äôs [OUT 2 LUNCH FESTIVAL DAY1 SET](https://youtu.be/vf53F3U_-Ik?si=NWqf-pySbk6xc6pr&t=602), I went nuts internally in the office. Hearing this being pumped out from gigantic speakers ***made me shiver.*** I was swaying randomly to the beats, and I‚Äôve never felt better. That whistle-like lead line was ***so groovy, so tempting.***

And, of course San Pacho is going to play his representative [Horny](https://open.spotify.com/track/04GYAnoZJajIurWLcjTMIF?si=06489bd54f7d4c5f)‚Ä¶

<h3>Made Some Friends 1.0</h3>

The sun set into the ocean, and I got tired from all the office work and sleep deprivation. I was leaning against the fence and letting the cool wind totally mess my hair up. I started taking selfies ***just because.***

A stranger guy asked me if I needed someone to help me take photos. Sure! Thank you so much.

![Messy wind messy hair](/img/blog5.0/stranger_me.jpg)
<small>Here is the photo he took.</small>

And that is how I joined his little friend group and ***danced in a small circle like there was no one else in the room.*** He said if I like this type of music, I should go to the club called ***bsmnt. Been there done that.*** It was my first 21+ party in which I cried to go back to Brandeis! Good times.

His girlfriend said she likes my top ‚Äî oof, SHEIN goods, iykyk. ***Fake black leather, tight on the waist. Showed some skin. 5 dollars.***

>Are you by yourself?

>Yeah!

>Yo yo, she is by herself! ‚Ä¶ Now come dance with us! We are friends now!

Excuse my dry description ‚Äî I really don‚Äôt know how to tell the joy in words. ***There are no words.*** When you sync up with other people to the same track, the connection is real and magical. A girl passed me a pair of ***paper sunglasses‚Ä¶*** It was the kind of glasses that filter the world with a ***kaleidoscope.*** My head was spinning again. Not because of the 3 shots I had. It‚Äôs from the chaotic blend of that ***late evening, blinding lights, strangers‚Äô friendship, fire bass,*** and all other people doing all sorts of shits. ***I was living in a real world that was slightly distorted on a Friday night,*** and I was so fortunate to get to perceive everything in its raw form by myself. Distancing from the shore once again put my head into a ***trance.*** San Pacho was still cooking, and thanks to the ocean waves, my hair was all over my face. I could barely see, so ***I just twerked.***

The guy said ‚Äî ***you can only join if u got good dance moves!*** So I just ***twerked,*** as in randomly moving in my drunk ass, and that passed the vibe check.

A tall girl said, you look so cute! I started blushing on the dark boat deck ‚Äî  No ***YOU*** look so cute! She said, you are so adorable‚Ä¶ For some reason, they like seeing me dancing without any human-like manner. Woo-hoo alcohol!

They were passing vapes. I didn‚Äôt take any hit ‚Äî W.

But when a girl pulled out a whole package of zyns and handed me one, I got it under my gum before I could think‚Ä¶ But ***I didn‚Äôt feel anything. Luckily I didn‚Äôt feel anything.***

>Where are you from? ***China‚Ä¶ Shanghai, China.***

<h3>Baby Got Back</h3>

Of course San Pacho is going to play [Baby Got Back](https://open.spotify.com/track/2DC888t0oMQlVOyda1QNn9?si=269a616459134519). The guy said, ***the dance floor is yours!*** Is it mine? My last bit of sobriety made sure I was humble enough to leave the crowd center empty. But BABY GOT BACK?!?! Oh girl, shake that ass. So we were shaking our asses ‚Äî Oh, my, god. ***Look at, her, butt.***

It was that, followed by [Sweet Dreams](https://open.spotify.com/track/1TfqLAPs4K3s2rJMoCokcS?si=69f8abacee0e495c) remix. San Pacho ended the set with [Cash Out](https://open.spotify.com/track/7qHSfKzilTsXJuuWcjX1vZ?si=766d95d207974966). I was shocked when he played that, because ***I was literally banging it for the last whole week.*** Man! I was dizzy again. I added one of the girls‚Äô Instagram accounts, said goodbye to the friend group, and left the cruise.

I went on a walk that ***lasted until 2 am.*** Little did I know that ***the cruise is just a pregame.*** Stay tuned.üòÆ‚Äçüí®
