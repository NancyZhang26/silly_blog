<h3>Main Plots Start Here</h3>

A compilation of moments, 2.0.

<h3>Your Uber-Car is Here</h3>

During lunch break, one of the interns said, we are going to see Q‚Äôs car! It was ***<u>just delivered to the company.***</u>

There are simply ***<u>too many questions***</u> that I decided to ***<u>ask none.***</u> Say less, just join.

Q‚Äôs ***<u>silver Tesla***</u> was sitting quietly in the sun. ***<u>Its polished skin reflected my astonishment in 1048p.***</u>

The inner design was pretty modern + techy. A screen, and another screen. Q gently ***<u>tapped a card***</u> above the car door ‚Äî that is how you unlock a car?! Like ***<u>a hotel room?!***</u>

We waved goodbye to Q. The Tesla sent an electric vroom vroom.

<h3>Vibe Coding Once More</h3>

Context: the Software Group Meeting

>Speaker: Do ***<u>NOT***</u> ask the copilot to give you code that you don‚Äôt understand! There will be bugs that you don‚Äôt know how to fix, and more issues.

<small>This comes from my Shanghai colleague, whom I will introduce in the next post.</small>

>Speaker: Vibe coding.. ***<u>DON‚ÄôT DO IT!***</u> If you do‚Ä¶ I will ***<u>CHASE, YOU, DOWN!***</u>

His half-joking / half-furious gaze is penetrating through the monitor screen. I had goose bumps.

<h3>Hawaiian Shirts</h3>

Context: Another daily standup.

I forgot if it was Vineet or Bertrand who complimented Bill‚Äôs ***<u>‚ÄúHawaiian-style‚Äù shirt,***</u> and someone said ‚Äî in his old company, there was once a tradition that ***<u>everybody needed to wear a Hawaiian-style shirt on Fridays.***</u>

I said, can we bring this tradition back into the house?

Anton said, ***<u>maybe‚Ä¶***</u>

<h3>If You Invite Me‚Ä¶</h3>

Context: Another daily standup.

Anton was not here yet, so I tried to bond with my teammates. I mean, I am just an intern, so ***<u>whatever I said could be forgiven.***</u> Yes or no.

Someone said, Bill, you have a nice attic! I like your wood-aligned ceiling in the background.

FYI, among the 5 of us, I was the only one working inside the office. ***<u>Give me the company VPN.***</u> Look in my eyes!

Bill said, nah, it is not my attic, just a room ‚Äî a room where ***<u>my wife and I used to dance.***</u> My wife was once ***<u>a semi-professional dancer!***</u> We used to have those dancing sessions at ***<u>the Christmas parties we threw‚Ä¶***</u>

FYI, ***<u>Bill is over 60 years old.***</u> I don‚Äôt know how or why he is still in this high-intensity work environment. Not really fast-paced, but relatively draining. Sometimes when Bill is trying to debug something, he does that hair massaging thing that Pauri does... Just like your old boss as you once told me Archer. Iykyk...

I had to say something.

I said, ***<u>Bill, if you invite me to your Christmas party this year, I will make sure to record all the dancing.***</u> Serious face for 1 second. Bursted into inappropriate laughter for the next 10.

Fortunately, I think Bill caught my joke. Everybody gave out a light laugh.

Anton finally joined the meeting. He smoothly blended in the conversation by saying he and his wife were once into ***<u>cha-cha and salsa dancing.***</u>

<h3>Bagels</h3>

Jocelyn is the nice lady who takes charge of all the food / resources / logistics... Every now and then I would get a ping mail from her saying: Food in 2xx! Get food before 4pm! Food...

There is one time I asked her, can I have the frozen bagels in the fridge?

She said, absolutely!

The next day, I greeted her on my way up to the office, and she said, by the way, just put some more bagels over there!

That was my daily high!

Jocelyn was going to New York for her vacation. I fake-cried to her: Who am I going to reach out to for bagels?

She said, sorry dear...

<h3>Indian Subways</h3>

Rishi was a buddy I connected with through Uber share. He is from a nearby company, and we always see each other at train stations or accidentally get into the same Uber. We car pooled a couple of times and are now chill buds.

He said, once he was in an Uber share to his office in the morning, and there were ***<u>2 big drunk dudes stuffed with him in the back row.***</u> It was in the morning!

He also said, in India, some subways/trains are wild‚Ä¶ There were so many people inside a section that some of them ***<u>hung outside of the carriage by holding on to the ladder?!***</u> Bhakti, is this true?!

He also said, Ronaldo is the goat. Not Messi. Ronaldo!

I said, I am a dumbass in soccer (üíÄ)... But, if people ask, I will forward them your opinion... And there is the opinion ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.
