<h3>Main Plots Start Here</h3>

Hey, things go fast right?

I am so scared right now almost having a panick attack. I beleive that things will go better, and the end of a cycle does not mean the end of something unrecoverable. I honestly don't understand what is troubling me. Saying goodbyes? I hate goodbyes. Why would people be not in touch anyways. The world is only this big. I will see you in Vegas tomorrow? Substances really fucks you up anyways. Can you save yourself? Why are you so shallow and can't take care of yourself. Shut up and hop on a flight. You hop on because you don't want to stay still. Staying still means you are being useless. Suck it up and just go.

Best regards.
