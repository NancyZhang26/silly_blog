<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

***Welcome to Chicago,*** says the Airport, and I thought I heard the city. John Summit’s hometown. Hey, I’ve heard loads of good things about you. Treat me well! I will leave a good word. Although it doesn’t matter, I will leave a good word.

<h3>Windy City</h3>

Running on 2 hours of sleep, I struggled through the airport and the Uber and arrived at the hotel. Pretended to work remotely for < 1 hour but ***logged 8 hours.*** Missed texts from my manager/coworker. Guess my work finally yielded some importance?

I asked the front desk about breakfast, and the front desk lady, after knowing my room number being ***420***, laughed out loud, the kind of laughter accompanied by wrinkles on her nose. The kind of laughter where she needed to bend over a little. 420! She said, ***That is a good number.*** She winked.

[420.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture)) I think this is meant to be fam.

I woke up, had a false alarm because I thought I slept through ***my date with Bhakti.***

Windy City did my hair. I hung out with Bhakti. Toured her apartment, walked around a park, ate good Japanese food, and got good food and liquor on the “Newbury St” in Chicago. Bhakti is building a life of her own right now, and I wish I could start mine too. ***I do want to feel capable.***

Facetimed a frog and multitasked through some company training jargon and a school course assignment (ChatGPT). It’s funny seeing his sleeping schedule leaning towards a normal human — no offense, I mean, what are you gonna do.

<h3>Lolla… And Tequilla</h3>

Thursday it is. Slept at 12 and woke up around 9:30. Called the school course counselor, did one LeetCode question, biked in the gym for a little while because the Hyatt gym is so fancy that I need to pretend to work out, and I started showering, taking shots, doing makeup, and banging Tomorrowland sets.

I UberEats a 200mL Tequila bottle because I don’t like the Baileys I got yesterday. I texted the Uber driver, ***“don’t let them see what I ordered lol.”*** She replied, ***“I got you.”***

<small>Evidence of blurred wrong-doing.</small>

Not gonna lie, it was those 4 shots that made me survive the walk to the Grant Park. Again, I was by myself, but not even by myself. I don’t even need to think. ***Following the groups of ravers*** would suffice. They always stand out.

![Pregame solo](/img/blog7.0/lolla_pre.jpg)
<small>Lolla I am fucking coming.</small>

Still drunk. I realized this by checking my album the next day. Not pretty!

I arrived at Grant Park and ***I was impressed by the bijillion people at Lolla.*** People people people. ***People mountain people sea.*** It was just so many fucking people. ***I fucking love it.*** Alcohol made me outgoing. I talked to guest service; I talked to retailers; I talked to strangers (how I got the photos). I finally navigated to the stage called ***Perry’s / renamed Dollapalooza*** because of [Dom Dolla.](https://www.domdolla.com)

![Corona Park](/img/blog7.0/lolla.jpg)
<small>Gigantic park, gigantic crowd.</small>

It was great timing. I started going to the bathroom 4-5 times in a row, and ***that was how I knew I was drunk enough and sobering up.*** I managed to sober up most of my drunk ass before [Cloonee](https://cloonee.com) goes on. The staged shimmered with red banners and a huge hand-script style “CLOONEE.” The crowd started surging. It started with a moan from [Stephanie](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sh2q76qsc7yLkQNmHKfQf?si=3f0596b729b54e32). ***Cloonee went on stage.***

<h3>Cloonee</h3>

![Cloonee](/img/blog7.0/cloonee.jpeg)
<small>Cloonee. Freaky!</small>

***You call her Stephanie, I call her Headphanie!!!*** What does that even mean? Does it even matter? I was jumping up and down like a monkey, but ***no way I could match the energy of the frat bro and sis near me.*** They are all professional ravers, carrying water bottles in backpacks with pipes and shit.

Holy god. ***I was seeing everything, hearing all the bass, smelling everything.*** Some people were taking edibles. Some vaping. Some smoking. The 420 went directly into my nose. Give me a hit! It was a mixture of ***heightened senses, over-the-bench low frequencies, and so many bodies.*** By bodies, I mean bodies. People’s bodies are bumping into one another. Some bros were not wearing a shirt, and still they bumped. I was swaying with the crowd because at some point, I could NOT stand on my own. I can smell people’s breath, sweat, perfume, and cologne. I can feel the heat coming from a collection of all the human flesh radiation. I can see their eyes, either red, cloudy, clear, maniacal, or hidden behind shades. The crowd was going up and down as a whole. ***Difficult to navigate, so might as well join the army.*** I don’t even need to move. I just need to lean on the flow and let the people carry me.

(JK! I was able to stand still.)

The tracklist was tailored to us maniacs. I stood way too in the front that the bass was hitting my fucking face, ***I couldn’t hear all other mid/high frequencies.*** I could only identify a song by hearing snippets of the chorus and the chanting from the crowd. But I love it. Isn’t it just the point of a rave?

<h3>Mau P</h3>

Cloonee followed by [Mau P.](https://maupmusic.com) That was me seeing him 1/3 times this weekend. I am quite familiar with his tracks, but still, ***I was amazed.*** The visuals are great, and ***he just love love LOVES edging us.*** It’s great to see “Mau P dancing” on the stage. When the Dutch hottie first started DJing, ***was he shy at all?*** No way do I think he could match Fisher, but man, he just got nominated as ***the white boy of the year.*** I guess a champ white boy wanna sway with a bit of classiness. But look at Fisher. I wish Fisher could be on this stage. Maurice played his rave playlist, full of hitters and getters (and setters? lol). Surrendering to crowd pressure, perhaps? Mau P likes wearing a bandana/beanie recently. It fits him well! ***Please take good IG pics, not 45 degrees up from your jaw.***

<h3>Dom Dolla</h3>

30 minutes till Dolly goes on, and I promised myself I would NOT move a single row. I thrived to be in the front row after 2-3 hours of crowd survival efforts, and just 30 more minutes — ***I got to enjoy a premium view with General Admissions.*** 30 minutes more. Just smell some second-hand smoke and chill. Just chill.

![Dolly](/img/blog7.0/dolla.jpeg)
<small>Dollapalooza.</small>

It is my first time seeing Dom Dolly live. The Australian DJ really got the crowd control power. When the narrating, stage-opening voice popped up with enormous subtitles written in cursive on the big display screen, people were blown away on another level. ***Throw away your Matcha Latte. Throw it in the trash. THROW IT AHHHH!!! Hug your friends.*** Oh well, I hug myself. Dom Dolly started with [No Room For A Saint,](https://open.spotify.com/track/5xalbHoIf0F0AmuTKlm2Ct?si=822865dbeac14c1a) oh gosh, the speakers were banging my fragile eardrums. He seemed quite lonely on the stage. ***It was just a Dom Dolla and the cameraman.*** Dolly! [Leave Me At The Love Parade](https://open.spotify.com/track/3z5fPVImx59TSttFEDZbFJ?si=798e716970864fc5) got me almost crying. There was a dude in the crowd ***doing a backflip.*** Everything was happening. Everything was in motion. The shots inside me long expired, yet I was more drunk than ever. ***Did EDM thrive in Australia? Dolly!!*** His closing parts were very heavy-metal techno. [Rhyme Dust](https://open.spotify.com/track/5mKiwDDrwG22qKKVL6JZqF?si=0dc140945e4040a6) did smell like dust. ***F Major is blue. Flat Majors are purple-ish. G Major is orange. E Major is yellow. C Major is white-ish.*** I used to regard C Major as green. ***A minor is grey-ish. Everything without a key is monotonous to me and looks like metal parts.*** The techno slices. Heavy metal, and they smell rusty.

<h3>OMW —> Radius</h3>

Silly me thought Mau P was really going to perform at 8 pm sharp. I quickly met up with ***Ella S.*** and ***Helene*** and started sprinting out of Grant Park to grab an Uber. ***NOTHING WAS WORKING.*** A 2-mile ride is 30+ dollars, and the Taxi by the road wouldn’t take me. The driver said, Since you are so beautiful, I am not going to charge you 40 dollars. I am ONLY going to charge you 30. My ass.

![Ella, Helene, Me](/img/blog7.0/me_el_he.jpg)
<small>I united with the seniors again.</small>

Get outta here!

>You can walk! Cermack St is not that far. It was right over there. You look so strong! Oh, you can walk.

I literally ***stripped my purse open*** to show him that I only had a ***20-dollar bill*** for emergencies. He still insisted on ***30 dollars.*** He said that the roads were blocked, and he had been waiting here for hours for ***big fish rides.*** Fine, fair enough. I started running back and forth between the street crossings and the subway station, because the Uber drivers kept canceling! And I somehow always got the wrong pick-up location! I need to run for ***10 minutes*** to get to the pick-up location! Fine. ***Subway it is.*** Someone popped open the emergency exit door. I tried to sneak in. My nails almost flipped trying to catch the lingering crevice as ***the heavy metal door shut right in front of my face.*** Bro.

I eventually got on the Bus that was, according to Google Maps, delayed for like 30 minutes or so. But there were other raves too. ***Wristbands don’t lie.***

I got off at a station called Archer something. ***It was deadly dark and silent.*** Everything was still except for the moving vehicles. Other ravers were going in another direction, but I trusted Google Maps. I started running on the bridge as the Windy City smothered my hair.

![Radius](/img/blog7.0/radius.jpg)
<small>I reached, but this is exactly what I was seeing. Everything was shaking. Never drink too much by yourself.</small>

I forgot show times in clubs are different from set times in festivals. ***Mau P did not go on until 1 am.*** I was raving for another 2 hours. I got into Radius at 11 pm, and the rest were just legendary :)

<h3>Mau P 2.0 @ Radius</h3>

Openers were fire. I learned about [Clüb De Combat](https://www.instagram.com/club_decombat/?hl=en). Talked to a few strangers. One of them was a white blonde boy called Matt who spoke ***native Chinese.*** He says he goes to Duke and interns at JPMorgan: “太无聊了！”

Anyways, Mau P was on and playing. I knew it. I knew his club playlist was going to be different from his rave set. I brag a little that ***I am a loyal follower.*** [Dress Code](https://open.spotify.com/track/00kiqMQGZQFH8YSiyrN8Ew?si=765a6046579040e7) finally came up, and then it was [Your Mind Is Dirty,](https://open.spotify.com/track/7B69sTCwpJdVtoe6WwMc5q?si=07804f2729a944cb) and some other chill, groovy, classy tracks. Give me that moan Maurice. ***Bang the hub right inside the club.*** I loved it. He played from ***1 am to 3 am*** onwards. The club officials notified him to check the time, but he kept playing.

<small>A maup at Radius</small>

I managed to sneak into the front row again. The speakers were on full volume, so full that ***I could only hear the kicks.*** But that was enough. To be honest, I haven’t eaten anything since the lonely pregame in the hotel room. ***My stomach started twisting,*** and my back and ankles are shaking. For a few moments, ***I thought I was going to actually faint,*** but then Mau P would raise a famous track that brought me back to life. The alcohol died away, and my throat was burning. ***I trusted my adrenaline and my passion.*** I knew I was going to get sick afterwards. ***Who cares.***

White boy of the year truly earned his unofficial award. He ended with a Flo Rida remix. Fun. ***The crowd started spreading like a fallen jar of sand.*** Cans, cups, trash. Everywhere. The club, even under max-power bright lights, looked like a limbo. The first thing I did after getting out was look for Mexican food trucks. Oooof that smell! Apparently, street food at 3 am became overpriced, just as anything else. I got some tacos and grilled beef, and inhaled them sitting beside a tree. The street was not dangerous at all. The stream of post-club people spread like creeks on the streets of Chicago. The sun does not need to rise to create a dome.

<h3>Windy City Treated Me Well</h3>

I Ubered back to the Hyatt. Started packing because ***the flight to El Paso is in a few hours.***

![Wristbands](/img/blog7.0/wristbands.jpeg)
<small>I was packing with those wristbands. The truth is, it turns out, being over 21 can give you so much benefits. Wh-ahhh!! Eye opening.</small>

I started remembering all the people I met and talked to before / during /after Lolla and Radius. ***The opener DJ*** for a Lolla artist called Boy Next Door (???iykyk). ***The salesperson*** who helped hold my purse. ***The girls*** with big fans. All the crazy, weird things were happening, and nothing paused for them. ***I was obviously overwhelmed, but not blown away.*** I know things are better ahead. Hotel breaky was refreshing. See you in El Paso.
