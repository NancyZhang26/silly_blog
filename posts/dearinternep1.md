[Dear intern](https://dearintern.net), you're fine...

Dear Intern ep1. Being Late on the 1st Day

<h3>Good Morning</h3>
I woke up at 6 am to sober up from my California dream. I checked the commuter rail. It leaves at 6:25. I need to take this one to arrive at the company at 8 am. Hell nah. Uber is taking only 17 minutes and costing 25 bucks. Why not.

So I went out for a run. Being stuffed inside basic economy last week tortured my spine too much. Too much that I felt a stitch under my right chest. This is how weak I’ve become. Yesterday I was cruising for 3 hrs in Miami for UAA. Today I can’t even run 3 miles.

I went back to the apartment only to enter the wrong password on the back door lock. The lock started screaming. My uncle-age roommate was making breaky 3 meters in front of me, separated by the glass door, and somehow he did not hear the siren. I entered through the front door eventually. Right combo, right sequence. I grabbed the door knob, and the knob came right off.

…
It was broken long before I came here. But it’s another story.

-Uber
I showered and figured I’d do some makeup. Fine, I drew way too much eyeliner. I looked like Avril, but not that pretty. Wait, the Uber takes 9 minutes to come here?! And it’s taking 30 minutes to get to the company.

I asked the driver, could you arrive before 8 please. Going to work? Yeah, and it’s my first day. I understand — I’ll try. Sorry I think we will arrive late. Just tell them that you missed an exit on the highway.

Ok…? I couldn’t lie, so I emailed the HR at 7:58. The email or myself - at least one of those should be there on time. Finally, I hopped out of the car, ran to the building door, and rang the bell. Buzzzzz. Nobody responded, and nobody is there. Am I this early?! No way. Did god just show himself? 30 seconds later, a guy who looks very tech opened the door — “You must be one of the interns,” he said.

Idk if it’s the despair in my face that sold me. So yeah, I’m an intern.

“The interns are in that building.” He pointed in a direction.

I thanked him, sprinted for 2 steps, and circled back: “Am I the only one coming to the wrong building?”

“So far. I will redirect the rest.” He said with a smile that was almost invisible.

My bro there is no “rest”. I am the anchoring joke!

I sprinted again. Oops, wrong direction. Turn and run. Finally! I was out of breath. The CTO was at the front door greeting all the interns who hadn’t arrived yet - in this case, me.

“Nice to meet you!”

A firm handshake.

“Nice…to….meet…you….I went…to the…wrong building….” I was so out of breath, or I was deliberately trying to act it out to play the poor girl card. I thought the CTO was seriously concerned for a bit. It was already 8:12 am.

“Are you ok? Do you need to take a break? Use the bathroom? Have some cold beverages?”

Oh no no no sir.

I kindly rejected his generous offer. I entered the meeting room: a room full of interns, and the lead recruiter simultaneously turned their head at me. I felt penetrated by all the (side) eyes. I tried to quickly scan the room for an empty seat. I ended up sitting near the center of the table. Stop grilling me!

-Meet Sombody, That, You Can Have a Drink With
The introduction prompt is: Name, Major, Choose: a preferred superpower / 2 truth and 1 lie.

Suddenly, another intern arrived - 8:20. Yep, suddenly my late ass wasn’t too intolerable. He was a Phd from MIT. Nvm! He got the school card, and I was back on the grill. He said, 2 truths and 1 lie — “I missed an exit on the highway.”

I said, if I had a superpower, I would want teleportation, so I won’t be late on my first day. A light chuckle travelled through the room.

“The people you are working with now might become lifelong friends.” Said the recruiter who’s worked in the US Army before, “You never know. They might become your good buddy whom you have a dr….”

The room shivered with laughter.

“...have a coffee with.”

-Helllllleeeerrr
The CTO was demonstrating the Google chat function, and he said, Let’s randomly send a message to Emma.

He typed: “Helll.”Quckly changed to “Hello”.I need to laugh. I need to.
