<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Frog,

It’s been so long since I wrote you anything long. I wasn’t planning on it, but as I was here in the corner of a UCLA dorm again, I felt so deja vu that I felt the desperate need to write something to you.

I was pretty lost after May. Everything felt so random. That random Reddit post which led me to the Eleventy repo and thus the silly blog. It’s the same weather same mattress and the same blanket, but different cats. There are two of them now!

Flashbacks seem pretty often to me. Every time I hear back from you, the night before I head to Palm trees, the building corner in front of Avalon… You were wearing your old glasses and the techno cap. You talked differently than you did in recitations. It was mid-summer June. Something you said made my heart beat one pace faster; something else you said made me cry.

The green sheets in Malden center, the white walls in Olivia, the million-dollar night view, Hell’s Kitchen across the street. From the tanks and jeans season to the 4 most unbearable months in North America. I didn’t like NY, but I never knew I could get attached to a city because of a person.

The only thing that did not change is those DJ sets that I always loop as I work. Mau P John Summit Fisher Max Styler Odd Mob. It’s just now I get tired of them too. It’s actually not been that long. A mere 6.5 months, but so much has happened. So much! When I look back, I feel proud that I managed to keep my life full. I could have lain back, but I didn’t, and I thank you for it.

You said you thought you were broken but so was I, can you believe it? I always thought I could meet some kind of savior, but there isn’t any sort of messiah but the person himself. I believe a good relationship is one in which two whole circles collide, not two halves trying to be compatible. I don’t know what I mean by that but, can you get drunk in front of me? I want to see you being vulnerable.

I do feel like I am being a better self after I met you. A whole different life. How would I ever know? Not a tennis maniac, just a bit bitter. Maybe not a nerd, but I never spent this much time on my laptop before.

I wrote so many personal statements, but none of them felt personal. I don’t like writing those academic jargon. So rigid and pretentious. What if we just cuddle? Born to frolic but lived to go through chains of purposes. I really want to get a full-time though, but I am so tired of having my hopes up :) When I refreshed into that Meta rejection letter… Oh my! It was my second-worst memory. But Meta is a symbol for me. It means mid-November and chilling in an apartment near Times Square with a frog. The frog is kind of silly. He codes like some super machine, but sleeps like a baby.

I once asked Zee whether it is too dependent to work hard for other people? But he said if it’s for a good cause… Say, if you want to protect your wife or provide a good education for your kids? I didn’t get it then, but I sort of get it now. I wanted to stay in the States now for some valid reasons… It’s getting a bit cringe isn’t it :3. Well, it’s late, and I am feeling kind of emotional. Ouch!

I guess what I’m trying to say is… Uh… I think I uh… I love you. I asked Jiayi what it even means to love someone. She said, it means if after a long day of being someone’s little bitch at work, you come home and see your man and your mood instantly light up, then iykyk. If that’s the case, I wish I could have said it right in front of your face.

Good night Froggie. I am so stressed, just really so so stressed. I haven’t been sleeping well for just so long. But oftentimes I think of you, and I fall asleep.
