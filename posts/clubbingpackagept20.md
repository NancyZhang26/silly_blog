<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

I can't believe I have not been updating on this tab for more than 6 months! I clubbed a bunnnnnnch, and here is a quick compilation of things.

Ever since the Chris Lorenzo concert @ The Grand before the Computer Networking finals and my winter adventure in LA, I have forced my liver into heaving lifting. I applied the YOLO mentality a little bit too hard.

<h3>List of Things</h3>

- Chris Lorenzo @ The Grand, mid-December
- 2* LA Academy, late December
- In Erin’s UCLA dorm all the way till daylight 🤣
- 3 times IDEK where, with Becca and Maddy :)
    - One of them: I briefly blacked out
    - One of them: the headliner was Valentino!
    - We did not spend a single penny inside the club for drinks
- MAX STYLER, (idek where it was; Froggie and I were crossed)
    - It was surprisingly not as hyped, but Maxy does know how to do the grooves
- 2/14 I did not go to San Pacho because I was busy submitting for grad schools…

<h3>Moments</h3>

I was looking back at my old posts, and I am incredibly grateful that I wrote things down in stories. I was reliving them as I glanced through them. I was checking my post in Nebula, and it was as if I woke up on that bed of a million-dollar view, or on a cheap flight from Texas to Boston. As if I were prancing back and forth in the living room with the sticky floor, waiting for a Frog to knock on my door. Christ! Summer seems so close. From the back and front at the same time.

I realized that I am losing loads of passion jotting things down. I chose not to remember that much because the info overload and sensitivity towards details are driving me crazy and stopping me from doing anything productive.

But I believe I am actually living it a bit more when I am actually feeling the seconds drifting by, rather than thinking about how I should package this into a narrative. I’ll always carry the narrative inside me.

It’s gonna be a good year, and I know it.
