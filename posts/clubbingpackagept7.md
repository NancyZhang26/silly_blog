<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

FYI, I took a look at the ocean this time.

I need a reason to storm out of the office on a Friday night, so there was Goldfish and the boat again. I listened to their set on Instagram, and the mixing of house and Saxophone is interesting. Almost ***country-house.*** So I got the tickets.

<h3>Pregame</h3>

I carried a shooter with me in the Uber. The shared rider girl asked if I wanted a piece chocolate. She was sweet. So sweet that I almost felt guilty when the car hit an abrupt stop, and ***the shooter fell out of my pocket and rolled over near her feet.***

Oops.

I drank up the shooter 50 meters away from the door. ***Don’t pregame under the bouncer’s nose.*** This is ***clubbing 101*** that I forgot about a month later. But that is a story for later.

…

The bouncer took a piece of ***zyn*** out of the zyn pouch from a group of girls and let them in. He put it ***straight in his mouth…***

The same bouncer found the vape from some girls. He asked, ***Is it sweet?*** The girls shook their heads. I almost thought the bouncer was going to take a puff. I am glad he didn’t.

<h3>Opener DJ</h3>

The opener DJ was a hot girl. Again, ***she clearly loves what she is doing.*** Later, I followed her on Instagram and found out that it took her one year to become an opener for headliners from a GA raver. Inspirational, truly.

I didn’t keep a tracklist. She played the usual bangers. Maybe some deep house. [Feel My Needs](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RiRFyvasDtAv8n0AQUKFG?si=c6d8c73064464d0a). That’s one I really remember.

<h3>Goldfish</h3>

It was not so much of a hype experience, as the Goldfish group was being musically innovative. Saxophone, electronic keyboards and flute paired up with live electronic keyboards seemed really creative. They are expressive musicians, and I can’t help to have a sense of awe.

<small>Not the Goldfish you eat.</small>

It started raining, but somehow still with a piece of falling sun. Drizzles were chill, but the sea breeze was a bit harsh. Luckily ***the radiation coming from all those humans*** neutralized it out.

<h3>Strangers</h3>

Some promoters were passing signed stickers around. I should have gotten one. A stranger asked me what the big stickers were. I told him it was autographed stickers, and he seemed impressed.

My safe spot was the pillar beside the trash can. A stranger asked me to help throw his empty beer cup into the trash can. ***Karma++.***

I had a new set of press-on nails ready, but they kept falling. Can’t complain! It’s under a dollar, so it is either ugly or brittle.

![Nails](/img/blog6.0/nails.jpg)
<small>Which one would you choose.</small>

I kept checking my nail. A dude asked me, ***Did you break your nail? My friend likes your nail!*** Later, he called his friend over to specifically check on my nails. She said, ***Those are gorgeous!*** Hehe.

The dude also said, ***I like your top! Is it leather?***

I said, ***I don’t know what it is, but it is like 5 dollars!***

Both of us burst into huge laughter, and we ***high-fived each other.***

Goldfish played the intro lead of [Seven Nation Army](https://open.spotify.com/track/3dPQuX8Gs42Y7b454ybpMR?si=e73bce9d0fea48da), and I could feel ***my blood rattling inside my nerves.***

I overheard 2 dudes in front of me chatting about festivals. Keywords: Chicago, Montreal popped out. I asked them ***if they are going to Chicago for Lollapalooza?*** Dom Dolly and Mau P are going to be there. They said nah, but they are going to Montreal to see John Summit. I said, ah, I was planning on going if it weren’t for the Visa issue.

>You have an American Visa, right?

>Yeah.

One of them shrugged: ***Just drive across the border. Chilling.***

<h3>After Party</h3>

I kept walking until I reached Seaport, which was hosting some Boston Cisco Beer gallery, or whatever that was called. Once upon a time, ***a frog told me he used to walk without music at 4 am to relieve some stress, and somehow I started doing that instead at 10 pm.*** Walking randomly in Boston after the cruise had become my new tradition.

<small>Nice view chill vibes.</small>

I met a product manager from a nearby company. He said his name is Moses. He was funny and a bit fruity. We talked for a bit and departed. He thought I was 26 or 27. I don’t know if that was a compliment, but I give kudos to the $5 leather top, if that was really leather.

<small>I admit it was not very safe.</small>

I kept roaming on the street until it started feeling spooky. The subway was empty with echos, and I was crossing fingers to a good night. Jiayi was very worried as she was facetiming me — take the fucking Uber, Nancy. ***Can you listen to you dear sister?***

![Empty Subway](/img/blog6.0/empty_subway.jpg)
<small>Again I admit it was not very safe.</small>

I mean, I really should, but it is literally Boston. I think I am way too naive in this cruel world, but I will live. And I did live. I reached home. Good night! Till next time, and many many more.
