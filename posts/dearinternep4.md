<h3>Main Plots Start Here</h3>

A compilation of moments, 1.0.

<h3>Multitasking</h3>

Someone was cued in on the meeting but had no idea what was going on. He resolved the tension by saying, ***<u>‚ÄúYou caught me multitasking.‚Äù***</u>

So that‚Äôs what it is ‚Äî In Chinese, we say we ***<u>touch a fish,***</u> and here we say we are ***<u>‚Äúmultitasking.‚Äù***</u>

<h3>Yapper</h3>

After we got off the Zoom meeting, two of the colleagues said ‚Äî in front of my face ‚Äî Yeah, ***<u>Anton was a yapper.***</u> He loses track of time quite often.

But I am his intern, and ***<u>I am sitting right here.***</u> Fellas?

‚ÄúYeah, no, I wouldn‚Äôt stop him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe seems passionate.‚Äù

<h3>Beginning of the Epoch</h3>

![Docker](/img/blog5.0/docker.jpg)
<small>Older than me.</small>

A Docker image that was created ***<u>55 years ago.***</u>

>Anton: Oh boy, that‚Äôs interesting ü§î

>Bertrand: We noticed it with Bill some weeks ago

>Anton: Some ***<u>time travel***</u> involved

>Bill: Somehow the timestamp on the docker image got set to 0.

‚Ä¶

Long story short, that is why this timestamp was set to the beginning of an epoch.

***<u>Unix time / Epoch time:***</u> a way computers measure time. It counts the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

-	Example:
	- Unix time 0 = Jan 1, 1970
	- Unix time 1720000000 = some point in 2024

If interested: ***<u>[Year 2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem?utm_source=chatgpt.com)***</u> - See you in 292 billion years!

<h3>Progress</h3>

Context: Daily Standup on a Monday. ***<u>Bill returned from his weekend hiking trip.***</u>

[People discussing their progress.]

>Bill: I made a lot of progress.

>Anton: Oh, nice. Tell us about it.

>Bill: ***<u>‚Ä¶Climbing 5000 ft.***</u>

<h3>Way Back</h3>

Docker! Why is it Docker again.

Bill was demonstrating the Docker commands for me.

He clicked on the terminal. I ctr + v the commands. He hit Enter. ***<u>All on the same set of keyboard, without saying a word.***</u>

He smiled: ***<u>You and I go way back.***</u>

<h3>Pig</h3>

There is a toy pig inside the meeting room, and people will squeeze it whenever the discussion deviates too much. The pig will make an ***<u>Onk***</u> sound that, idk how, alerts people to stay on topic.

Legend said that the VP cannot get over this ‚Äúalarm pig‚Äù that he saw in one of his business trips, so he imported this legacy.
