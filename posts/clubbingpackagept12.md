<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

This will be a short casual post. Just a regular weekend hitting the club. Cheers to ***a frog*** who helped get my shit together.

Let's raise another glass to Chirag, whose ***tolerance*** I can definitely approve of.

<h3>Clubbing 101 :) </h3>

Exhausted from work. Got home. Late run. Showered. Napped. Ate. Dressed up. Checked out the inside of Club Cafe when ***a frog was stuck inside the train for a few minutes.*** Good club! Very rainbow. Very diverse. When I say everybody is slaying, I mean for real, people are slaying. ***Pop hits, Skins, heels, heavy eyeliners, glitters, and shoulder bags.*** I was dizzy again. I wanna stuff some tips inside the dancer‚Äôs ___. I didn‚Äôt though, because I was a shy girl. Hehe.

I met up with a frog. He‚Äôs got the goodies, and I just desperately needed to get drunk. We finished in total maybe 4-5 shots of alcohol. 50-50 split. Thanks pal!

I was stupid enough to ***drink and throw the shooter bottles away right in front of the bouncer*** damn it. 2 shots, and I couldn‚Äôt even relocate where I was in the line anymore. Even the strangers beside him seemed worried. ***I was so fucking awkward that I just wanted to shovel my head under the pavement.*** Byee.

The bouncer pointed at us: ***Alright, so you two cannot enter. Going to bars 101 ‚Äî don‚Äôt pregame right in front of the bar!*** Drop dead. I just RIP myself socially. People were looking at us. Please don‚Äôt. Froggie said, It‚Äôs chill. It‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs really not a big deal, but my self-consciousness just peaked. Girl.

This is the moment when I know I should be a moderate drinker.

<h3>Bsmnt</h3>

***Bsmnt*** was just around the block. After walking around the area for a bit, we decided to go inside Bsmnt as it was known for some good ***underground EDM.*** The DJ was doing his thing, edging us and dropping some good beats. Excuse me for not keeping a tracklist, because I don‚Äôt know almost any of the songs! Frequencies. How do they make sense?

We were having some good times. Hehe.

We went back after about 2 hours of vibing to underground house. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs chill. The ***subway shenanigans*** happened again. The subway service stopped after 1 AM. I thought we were the chosen ones, having an entire station empty just to ourselves. Silly me. Froggies was carrying my shoulder bag. Kate Spade looks so good on you!

<small>Fresh knowledge: a subway station is empty probably because the service stopped.</small>

We Uber-shared, but had 3 riders joining in total. So it was 4 of us stuffed inside a regular car. ***The invisible side eyes were going rampant inside the car.*** Sorry. I said I am sorry!

Back to Malden. We made it. A win is a win‚Ä¶

<h3>Club Cafe 2.0</h3>

Literally the next day, I went to Club Cafe again with Chirag, with some grudge. I mixed Gatorade with Tequilla. ***Do you know what happens when you mix Gatorade with Tequila? You get happiness.*** Period.

I learned my lesson, sir. We were drinking that shit up a block away from the club entrance. We finished every single drop.

Again, not much happened in the club. I don‚Äôt even remember the tracks played because, hehe, ***I guess I wasn‚Äôt being moderate at all.*** That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt trust what people say when they are drunk. ***They were being real, but there is a bandwidth, which is usually insanely short.***

Anyways, the vibe was chill. I was drunk. I got back safely. I passed out. I woke up early. I felt like shit. It was as if somebody banged my head against the wall. I asked Chirag to ***please voluntarily forget whatever random shit I said about life being doomed or me being delulu during the pregame and the postgame.*** He said, uhh, did you say anything? Doesn‚Äôt ring a bell.

Good friend. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è

Till next time, and many many more.
