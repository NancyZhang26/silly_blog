<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

üö® ***<u>ALARM: THIS IS A GIRLY POST IN ACTION.***</u> üö®
<h4>Recap:</h4> Watty and I went to Brookline for dinner, bumped into Daniel Shemesh, and came back to his apartment for pregaming while watching Twilight: Breaking Dawn. (<a href="{{ '/posts/clubbingpackagept1/' | url }}">Clubbing Package Pt.1. Watty in a Club (???)</a>)

<h3>From Too Much Sex To MiddleSex</h3>

Continuing from watching ***<u>Bella and Edward passionately go at it on that extravagant queen-size bed -- breaking it, of course‚Ä¶***</u> I noticed that some scenes were cut from the original release. That‚Äôs fine. But what‚Äôs not fine was that Watty noticed it too, noticing it and saying (with a neutral tone), ***<u>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why they cut those scenes. They were good.‚Äù***</u>

Watty when did you watch ‚Äúthose scenes‚Äù?? And ***<u>what other ‚Äúscenes‚Äù are you comparing them to??***</u> What is your standard of a sex ‚Äúscene‚Äù being ‚Äúgood‚Äù? I never get what‚Äôs on his mind since I was already flattered that his average response in our convo spanned more than 5 words. Being surprised and impressed and confused, I just continued to drink, and drink, and drink again.

And we were in ***<u>this club, MiddleSex,***</u> because, according to the Instagram promotion, it was ***<u>the only club hosting an event on a Thursday night.***</u> 

I don‚Äôt even wanna talk about it because ***<u>it was so awkward.***</u> Even that DILF bartender could not save the awkwardness of Watty and me staring at the middle-aged crowd dancing to disco-house. The club was kind of mid. There was only one lobby separated into a dance floor, a sitting space, and a car, and the DJ booth.

I think ***<u>I wrote my DJ info on a napkin and passed it to the bartender.***</u> That was the sign that the tequila shots started working.

Again, I couldn‚Äôt tell if Watty was unhappy or just chilling. Either way, he picked a sports+arcade club called ***<u>‚ÄúLucky Strike‚Äù***</u> and decided that we should at least have some fun instead of admiring some old-school dance moves. It was when we Ubered to Lucky Strike and walked in that I realized ***<u>I had been here with my ex in my freshman year.***</u> 

<h3>Lucky Strike</h3>

Lucky Strike was highkey kind of bougie. The whole thing has 2+ floors, with the first floor being an arcade, and the second one being a bowling venue. The red lights were somehow sketchy. 

I was way too sober for this, being 1-on-1 with Watty, who cherishes his words more than his bank account. ***<u>I immediately ordered an Espresso Martini and chugged it.***</u> Ew it just tastes like sugary water. Gives me the ick, but luckily some dizziness too.

Watty and I were hanging out on the arcade level for a bit, and ***<u>a random janitor gave us a free game card that allows an hour of free playing (?!).***</u> ‚ÄúJust use it.‚Äù He said with a smile, raising his white eyebrows.

We swiped the card on a table hockey machine, and this activated the 1-hr timer, which WE DID NOT NOTICE. I screamed like a little girl, and Watty was just smiling as usual.

We went up to the second floor after 15 minutes and bought a 30-minute bowling session. 

‚ÄúYo check it‚Ä¶‚Äù Walking in a non-straight line, ***<u>I swung my arm and threw the bowling ball in the exact way of hitting a forehand,***</u> with a little bit of follow-through and a little bit of sassiness. Watty pointed his phone camera at me, and I was flexing at how fast the ball detached from my hand and sprinted to the pins just like how I sprint to Gosman at 7 am. 

***<u>And it sprinted right into the gutter.***</u> I was laughing like a maniac, and Watty was laughing like a gentleman. It was his turn. He raised his arm and released it. The ball steadily rolled down the lane and ***<u>knocked down every pin.***</u>

‚ÄúOk?? You are on camera!‚Äù I yelled a little bit too enthusiastically. I pointed my phone at Watty, documenting how he then confidently and smoothly pitched the ball into the ***<u>gutter.***</u> 

Strike after gutter, gutter after spare‚Ä¶ Not surprised since my aces and double faults always alternate gracefully. I really had a good time. The Espresso Martini might have helped me. 

Before leaving the bowling venue, I asked the cashier for a pen and paper and wrote him my DJ info. He said he will ‚Äúgive it to his manager.‚Äù God knows what I scribbled. Hopefully not my WeChat.

We returned to the arcade level and noticed that there were only 15 minutes left on our game card. We just played several rounds of simulated race cars. ***<u>Watty hit some good records, and I hit some other cars.***</u>

<h3>Nothing Happened</h3>

It was just us hanging out in Lucky Strike tbh. It was funny, but nothing romantic happened. I mean I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything either.

I really don‚Äôt know where or when I got the butterflies from. Maybe it was when Watty was driving me around for 1 hour+ and paying for the tickets and drinks without a second word. Maybe it was when I tried to read his mind, and failed every time. Or, maybe my heart was racing only because of the drinks.

I know I am not going to ask or make anything happen either. We barely talked this semester anyway. It was just comfortable spending time with this dude with the finals behind our heads. It felt safe. It was different from hanging out with the girls.

Watty is always a good friend to me. Honestly, he is nice to everybody. He always does people favors and does not ask anything back in return. 

He told me to Uber back to his place, and he will drive me home.

He parked his car right outside the Ridgewood Terrace and walked me to the Ziv 128 elevator. My head was spinning.

I told him I wanna see him again before he leaves. 2 days later, he stopped by my dorm and bought me an iced-shaken espresso from Starbucks. We just talked for a couple of minutes, and he left to catch his flight. 

I think I will miss him, but not so much that I started ordering sugary cocktails. 

I will miss him in the same way that I miss all my other friends. That‚Äôs all.
