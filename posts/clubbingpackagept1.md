<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

üö® ***<u>ALARM: THIS IS A GIRLY POST IN ACTION.***</u> üö®
No more cocktails for me ‚Äî although that bartender is‚Ä¶ kind of hot.

<h3>This Is NOT a Date</h3>

Of all the people among the COSI 29A survivors, Watty and I were the only two still on campus + above 21. ***<u>Let‚Äôs go clubbing after finals,***</u> I said in the Cheesecake Factory, ***<u>and Watty agreed.***</u> That was the sun rising from the West.

Watty finished his last exam and called me in the middle of the WTEN team meeting. The plan is we‚Äôre going for dinner, and then pregame, and then find a club.

I said, ‚ÄúDress decent.‚Äù And Watty showed up in a  ***<u>buttoned-up white shirt and black jeans in his silver Mazda.***</u> I looked down at  ***<u>my mistress-style dress and my smoky smoky eyeliner.***</u> And my ***<u>coach shoulder bag.***</u> And my ***<u>flamboyant earrings with fake gems.***</u>

What is it, a date?

<small>Ew cringe.</small>

I would normally give myself an inner laugh and hit the road. ***<u>I don‚Äôt chase. I attract.***</u> Wtf Nancy. You watch too many Instagram reels and have obviously picked up some imaginary cockiness.

But it‚Äôs Watty. It is literally Watty ‚Äî Watty with his one hand placed casually on the steering wheel, waiting for me in the Slosberg parking lot; Watty throwing me his phone and saying, ‚Äúcue some good songs.‚Äù And that was just the cherry on top. ***<u>Being the passenger princess that I am,***</u> I don‚Äôt even know what place we are going for dinner, because Watty has it all. It feels awesome when the other person has a plan, and all you have to do is nod and nod and nod.

After 20 minutes on the ***<u>Buosdon***</u> highway, driving past that New Balance shop (hey Summer) for the 10086th time, we arrived in a cutsey ramen place in Brookline. Watty parked on the side road, and we had a moment trying to read the instructions on a meter that was clearly built 10+ years ago or so.

I guess ***<u>if they were giving us a hard time paying, then we shouldn‚Äôt pay at all.***</u> But we paid. Because Mr. President, I like the US air. I wanna stay here for a little longer.

Then we saw one of the most familiar faces from Deis. Watty was shocked as if the meter started talking ‚Äî It was Daniel. ***<u>Daniel Shemesh from the men‚Äôs team.***</u> Is the city too small, or were we related in another life? Anyways, great to see a Deis face. Danny looked at us up and down and smirked, ‚ÄúYou two are all dressed up! Where are you going?‚Äù Before I could process the plot twist, Watty answered with an innocent excitedness, ‚ÄúClubbing!‚Äù

Now I am nervous that I will have to provide the most unforgettable clubbing experience to my homie. But it is a Thursday evening, and I am sober and even ***<u>more sober than I was before my OS exam.***</u> We will see.

<h3>Dinner, and No Drunk Driving</h3>

The ramen was great. Had a light debate over who should pay. Watty would you let me feel masculine just for a little bit? He paid, but ***<u>I regained dominance by Zelling him back,***</u> because I didn‚Äôt pay him for the Cheesecake Factory last time, and I already have a dad who pays for my everything.

We visited a Japanese shop right beside the restaurant, and realized that Watty cannot be driving if we are going to have a drink. I feel so bad. Watty drove us back to his apartment for a bit of pregaming.

Spent 30 minutes trying to configure the projector. I contributed! Talk about women in STEM. I wanna watch a horror movie, but somebody was a pus*y (jk). So we watched ***<u>Twilight: Breaking Dawn.***</u>

<h3>Too Many Sex Scenes</h3>

Before I noticed, I have finished a whole bottle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazake#:~:text=Amazake%20(ÁîòÈÖí%2C%20%5Bamazake%5D,mentioned%20in%20the%20Nihon%20Shoki.">Amazake</a>, which Watty grabbed from my hands and paid for relentlessly. But, I think I might have spilled 50 mL of liquor on the floor, but I quickly put the air purifier on the spill, so I didn‚Äôt spill anything at all. Except this massive amount of tea rn. Sorry Watty!!

Bella was biting her lips for the 6176784891th time. Bella was looking uncomfortable for the 3392159470th time. Bella was getting married right after high school! ***<u>Bella was sprinting into Jacob‚Äôs arms at her own wedding with Edward!***</u>

I couldn‚Äôt help but comment, ‚ÄúI would never tolerate my significant other catching feelings for another person.‚Äù But Watty said, ‚ÄúSo what are you gonna do?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave them! Duh.‚Äù

But Watty said he would ***<u>just accept it.***</u> Lowkey, I think we should watch Notebook.

 ***<u>‚Ä¶Bella was gonna hand over her v-card to Edward!***</u>

On the 14-inch MacBook screen (projector failed), Bella was anxiously brushing her teeth, shaving her legs, and bathing in a bathtub full of foam.

Watty, asking the most innocent question in the Wattiest way: ***<u>‚ÄúWhat is she doing?‚Äù***</u>

I, with my poor #__ bodies, suddenly felt a sense of seniority. So I said, ***<u>‚ÄúGetting ready for sex.‚Äù***</u> Word by word. Syllable by syllable.

Watty gave out a silent laugh. Maybe he was genuinely entertained‚Ä¶ Until Bella started digging in her suitcase searching for matching lace underwear. Watty asked (flirted???),  ***<u>‚ÄúDo you do that too?‚Äù***</u> And that just pulled me back to the reality of ***<u>my horrendous sex life, including no pre-college marriage or a trip to Bali, only a plan B.***</u> So I said, ***<u>‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù***</u> trying to add some suspense.

And there were ***<u>Bella and Edward smudging each other in the ocean and rocking the bed, and Bella seducing Edward in some ways that I can only admire.***</u> The silence in Watty‚Äôs apartment was so loud. The elephant in the room was screaming. We finished those scenes like decent gentlemen, commenting on the beauty of human nature‚Ä¶ <h4>Nahhhh, don‚Äôt tell me you bought that.</h4> We just made some neutral comments, which I will probably tell you in the next post. (Boooooo!! üëª)

We did not finish the movie because we were heading out to this random a*s club by then. Watty was the one who turned this awkward experience into a comedy, and I so appreciate that.
