<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Do you know ***dog*** backwards is ***god***?

<h3>I Got Chased By a Dog</h3>

The cruise is in 3 hours. I went for a run because why not.

I ran past a house. A man was sitting on the porch stairs with a bulldog by his side. There was no leash. The man and his dawg were side by side like two good pals.

Mau P’s house set was banging in my ears, but I vaguely heard someone calling “baby baby.” Surely not to me! The voices became closer, so I looked back.

Oh man. ***The dawg was running after me*** all the way from the porch.

He looks quite happy though. He has that ***sticking-his-tongue-out cute dog face.*** But his owner was apparently not happy… A stranger helped grab and calm down the dawg as well. I was tempted to pet the dawg but didn’t. I kept running and chuckling all the way till I went past Malden Center.

A few days later, when I ran past the same house, I saw the man and his dawg again. This time ***with a leash.***

<h3>Boston Cruise Virgin Tour</h3>

It was my first time ***raving by myself.***

I got ***hammered at Revere Beach*** yesterday, and I promised myself I won’t drink a single drop.

When I told Chirag I’d dry party today, he easily poked through my fragile promise. The truth is, he is totally right. ***I got a drink with my “back-up” cash*** — why did I even think I need cash in my purse?

<small>Love it.</small>

I don’t know if it was first-impression bias, but among the 3 cruises that I went to, I think I enjoyed D.O.D’s opener DJ the most.

<small>It was this girl!</small>

When she played Fisher’s [Losing It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ho0GyrWZN3mhi9zVRW7xi?si=e1c9e9f0f3d74a48) mixed with MEDUZA’s [Piece of Your Heart](https://open.spotify.com/track/1DFD5Fotzgn6yYXkYsKiGs?si=87401bfd355342e6), I knew today is going to be unforgettable. She transposed Piece of Your Heart into a ***g minor,*** and everything blends in perfectly.

She also mixed [Sound of da Police](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Y6XWs8xMlCngyIxNOFnsp?si=ad797df6aa974c96) and [Mr. Brightside](https://open.spotify.com/track/003vvx7Niy0yvhvHt4a68B?si=645f75a7e80b4289). The sirens lit up the crowd. People were jumping. ***The top of their heads went up and down like artificial waves.***

[Messy](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SKH53SPQbEnZR4cJPVaz2?si=69132d15fa9e4a8c) remix, [Fake ID](https://open.spotify.com/track/2VuzBUB5V9AlpniCUhaszP?si=e2be2ecb744e4ba3) remix, [Waiting For Tonight](https://open.spotify.com/track/5uz3XmT2mbY8eCl1IXDzMF?si=6e6a921204ea42a9)…

<h3>Strangers - Photos and a Can</h3>

D.O.D was up! He started with [So Much In Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/7DnI3ktF2vcmzKuCCKseQL?si=56f98f3e8b544077), [Every Step](https://open.spotify.com/track/7me5d5XmtCCfbDk3SsyXqM?si=0cb4f314126c4ff3) … All his bangers in his top 10 discographies on Spotify, along with other famous house tracks and fun remixes. I think his style was very similar to [Calvin Harris’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7CajNmpbOovFoOoasH2HaY?si=_ViykT7SRwuEGaV7HQizPA). Both are less techno and more melody-focused, often blending in a bunch of ***MIDI pianos*** or other catchy lead instruments in ***syncopated beats.*** D.O.D mixed in and out very smoothly. Professionals! It was a chill-hype vibe.

If there was one thing that I noticed, ***there were so many frat bros.*** By frat bros, I mean ***finance-looking guys wearing buttoned-up short-sleeve shirts with sunglasses and a drink in their hands.*** The way they raved was similar as well. ***The sway!*** I couldn't stop chuckling. I swear I saw a Brandeis bro. Small city, small cruise.

There was also this friend group besides me, busy taking group pictures with a camera. A dude with a baseball cap asked if I could ***help them take a picture,*** and I did. In their next picture, the cap bro asked if I wanted to get in, and I got in.

Cap bro started socializing. He asked, ***what’s your name?*** Nancy. ***Where are you from?*** I could have said Boston, but I want to sound interesting, so I said China. I mean I AM from China. ***Where in China?*** Shanghai, China. One of the other boys asked with his drunken eyes, ***is that the good part or the bad part in China?*** I don’t remember my answer, but I decided that starting from now I will play my international card every time. It’s a good story, and ***if you have a good story, people will probably ask you to be in their group photos!***

Some guy asked me to throw his empty beer can into the trash bin, since I was standing right beside it — and I did.

<h3>Track List</h3>

Another fratty dude was telling some girls — ***the DJ is his brother.*** D.O.D is your brother? Then why are you in general admissions?

D.O.D kept cooking behind his sunglasses. He played Mau P’s [Like I Like It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6vLKVWEuOCQAWEaHv2yknm?si=0d864a9130cb42ec), [Walking on a Dream](https://open.spotify.com/track/5r5cp9IpziiIsR6b93vcnQ?si=b05701d0327e4229) remix, [You & Me](https://open.spotify.com/track/1snNAXmmPXCn0dkF9DaPWw?si=4d2790eebd884ed0) remix, [Sweet Nothing](https://open.spotify.com/track/24LS4lQShWyixJ0ZrJXfJ5?si=0966830375894a83), [Set Me Free](https://open.spotify.com/track/5zA3gMIFlgnhNQj39GcTqE?si=cabbd1216a214ed9), [The Days - NOTION Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/2FAZskT9yRjp2Oow9szJD8?si=2ebb09e08dc749a2), [Summer 91](https://open.spotify.com/track/7pARbCUoO1CTzU5ucMEaVF?si=950fd756509a407d), [(It Goes Like) Nanana](https://open.spotify.com/track/23RoR84KodL5HWvUTneQ1w?si=c1134bb9d4fa4119)… All the classy stuff. Also [this ID at 25:49](https://youtu.be/vf53F3U_-Ik?si=VQ0YHHa_eibWoOZM&t=1549), which I think might be a Fisher release soon. I guess in the circle, people all talk!

<h3>The Aftermath and Charles River</h3>

Time flies, and we were back on the dock before I realized that D.O.D ended his set. I was so locked in on the DJ that I forgot to watch the sunset. I’m sure it was something majestic. ***A mixture of all the possible colors.***

I can't just go home like that. I needed to walk more. There was so much on my mind that ***it felt empty.*** Stepping on the real land again now - I felt surreal. I knew Malden was on the east, so I kept walking in that direction. I walked past the highway bridge above the Charles River. I walked downstairs to the sightseeing benches. ***The night brought up mists, and my eyes blurred.***

<small>Misty misty.</small>

There were ***couples whispering in a distance*** and ***drunk kids goofing in the background.*** I squeezed my Coach purse tightly and stared into the aquatic void. I couldn’t figure anything out. But seriously, ***what do I need to figure out?*** I couldn’t reason at all.

***Midsummer, house music.*** I guess this is all that’s worth remembering and pouring into my blog.

Today is 7/12, and I am writing about a 6/28 raving experience. I was going to jot down everything right after, but somehow I was drained by all sorts of chores. 2 weeks passed by just like that. But unlike my usual semester days, these 2 weeks felt long — ***I was brave enough to try out all the different things by myself,*** and maybe I will give kudos to myself this time.

I often panic before I write because I’m scared that I cannot capture the best moments. I’m also afraid that my plain English is dragging the narratives. I am not a good writer, but I want to preserve the stories as much as possible.

I don’t think I should give too much dame about it. ***The more I care, the less free I am,*** and the blog will not be a safe space anymore.

Little did I know that this cruise with D.O.D would lift the curtains of my magical summer rave experience. Or should I say the Hamptons has already told me that House was more than my passion. The charm of EDM gets me mesmerized every time. I think I should thank Jack for introducing me to [Danielle (smile on my face)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2sLVs5iX0osogh4jcsAJkv?si=7f814017bf9a4f9f) that night in 2023 in front of Rosie. It was when everything started.

Thank you D.O.D. See you again Boston cruise.
