<h3>Pre-BOS Saturday</h3> 
It was like a fucking movie. Losing both my singles and doubles with a bad sunburn and skin peeling off my shoulders. Feeling like Michael Jackson, I watched my dear seniors clinching against CWRU, cheering, and screaming. It was a celebration in its raw form. Such a bittersweet moment. Can’t do anything other than ordering a drink from the bar in Hilton Honors and spilling it in the car park, and picking up another booze from Rebecca. God, Lord forbid Pauri from knowing this. I have no words for this man. Sometimes he gives me some genuine kindness, and other times I just want to shovel some meat into his mouth. Coaches. I respect all of them. 

<h3>Pre-game Sunday</h3> 
Flying back and then Spring Fest. Doing work here and there. Showing up in PJs, surrendering to imaginary peer pressure by borrowing a skort from Bhakti. This is not a typo. A skort is a skort. Mad drinking and mad eating. Triple crossed. Losing my mind. My head is spinning. Saw some girls flashing. Saw some guys flexing. Ending up in a food + alc + 🍃+ 🌫️ coma. Woke up, took a shower in Gosman and went straight for a chamber music rehearsal. Hitting all the wrong notes in the dark recital at 9:30 pm. The red exit lights were so fking scary. 

<h3>Messy Monday</h3> 
Went to my 8:30 am class and fell asleep with my feet dangling in the front seat when only ~12/~50 people showed up in the lecture. Did an interview, wearing my long-ass coat in 77°F because I don’t have a business casual. When the 40-year-old+ Ukrainian interviewer asked about JavaScript Typescript and Node.js, all I did was ramble. I have only one word: ChatGPT. I did not mention it even once. His eyebrows kept rising and dropping. Stop judging me bro. I thought Ukraine and China are good bros. Please be kind to a 21-year-old girl who still has a hangover. Too much hangover that I forgot to mute myself practicing a music presentation during the following zoom class. When I emotionally said “xxx music…flamboyant fashion….” the guest speaker talking about some hard-as-f machine learning said: “Yes, this xxx graph does have a flamboyant fashion.” See, consensus from a pro.

Went to a presentation, only to realize that we neither have a thesis nor 4 scholarly citations. 0 interests in jazz history, 1000% in securing an A. Refined the slides in 20 minutes with some AI assistance. The class was clapping for 10+ seconds. Thanks Ace for making the music video. I did not know what the hell was going on. You should flex. I’m just tallking shit. Yeah, talking shit and skipping the last OS class. Sorry professor. It’s not personal.

<h3>Thrilling Tuesday</h3> 
No more waking up at 6 am. Did my guitar class. Hitting all the wrong notes again. Went to study. I never knew how the question “What is a computer?” could torture me from the inside out. Then getting ready for the piano recital in the evening. Didn’t even wear a dress. I wanna look pretty, but I was so tired. No more heels. Save the toes for the aftermath. Hitting all the wrong notes again. Thank you and sorry to the ones coming. No more piano for this semester. Don’t need another thing other than tennis reminding me of the failures in my life. Went for a 3 hr study sesh again in SCC. The DJ was cooking Michelin, and I was cooking my cheat sheet. Would have asked for his contact but got too tired. TLDR, this guy is amazing. Gave me such a vibe for studying, such a motivation locking in on DJ too.

<h3>WTF Wednesday</h3> 
Did I say 2 finals? No I didn’t. Well after the first one my hand hurt from writing. When I submitted my exam paper, prof said “Thanks Nancy.” Awww! He remembers my name! Not surprised based on the ~500-word email I spammed him and the ~500-word reply he gave me. I love this blue-eyed dude. Please take Delfino’s class my homies. What a guy. Studied for more OS, skipped more classes. Did more studies and practiced more guitar and headed to Slosberg again for my guitar jury. Who’s there? Three white-hair professors, and Pierce. Nervous? Hell yeah. Choked? Duh. Fingers were trembling. Voices were shaking. Tunes are deviating. Only hoping that nobody noticed I sang the same sentence twice because they are in Chinese. Either way, done. One of the professors gave out a light laugh when I was playing “Don’t Get Around Much Anymore.” He has GOT to be impressed by my skills man. It’s gotta be because of that. 

Guitar jury done! I was unplugging the cord from my amplifier. Oops, what’s that fking stinging feeling? Guys, my heart almost stopped. Guys, I just got an electric shock. Did I just become an X-Man? Na. I just became stupid because I forgot to turn off the amp before unplugging. It’s whatever. I didn’t see God, so God blessed me. Amen. Let’s go study OS again.

After a 1-hr back-and-forth texting full of “???” and “...” with my bro, it is OS time! What is a computer? I don’t fking know! The bro in front of me was staring at the big blank space under the question, I was chuckling at the absurdity of this exam. Done. No more OS — wait, still need to learn C. But whatever, Grabbed a quick meal with Pierce and his guys, and I started zoning out on Chapel's field. Such lovely weather. Such a sad girl. A random guy asked me, “Are you performing tn? Does it start from 7:10?” — Wait, he is the one that Andrew kicked out of the recital hall when Kels and I went to practice yesterday. Oops, sorry. And no, it starts at 7:30.

Went to watch the second chamber performance. There was Nick who played cello without wearing his shoes and his bow peeling because he was playing so hard (in a good way. My jaw dropped.) There was a girl who played piano so fast I couldn’t see her fingers. Wow, why did I come? I don’t know!

Had a good 30-minute talk with Pauri about picking the right photos for Brandeis Tennis Instagram. Man, you gotta spare me the Cali money. If you don’t, nothing is gonna happen. I am just bluffing.

<h3>Thrashing Thursday</h3> 
Went to Bhakti’s thesis defense. Contemplated my plan to visit Vegas casinos. Conclusion: no more walking more than 10 meters in heels + Bhakti was such a goat. Then there was the student-athlete banquet. Why are the soccer bros moving to the front? Idc. We love to see awards given to other teams in close distances. Why is that man also sitting so close to our table? Why is he wearing a purple shirt? I don’t know. I don’t care. But somehow I became mad. The food is not bad. Sarbina, Gabe, and Sabrina’s friend group slayed again. Idk man, some people are just born different. I would just admire and pray.

Yapped with Johnny for a bit. Practiced and fixed my DJ set for 2+ hours. Eyes were closing. Sound check in Sherman Functional Hall? Fk, why isn’t the sound playing. Why is my software bugging. Wtf, RekordBox, give me back my 20 dollar subscription fee you mtrfker. Oh, false alarm. Nvm, take my money.

SA formal. I love every single second of it. Can’t stress more how much I love DJing. I love seeing the crowd dancing. I love seeing my dear ones having a good time. I love reading the story. Had a mental struggle, did not drink a single drop because once in forever I need to be professional. Why is that man being pushed in front of the DJ table again. Why is the glitter on my dress everywhere. I don’t fking know. I only know I was so sad knowing that this night with Bhakti Stassi and Sabrina will never come back. So sad knowing I will probably never see some of the faces again. But I will totally do it again. 20+ hrs song searching and set writing and deck practicing. I will totally do it again. 

The next thing I know, 7 people shoveled themselves into a 4-seat car. Watty, we gotta pay your gas money. Aidan’s shoulders are on my legs, and I am feeling every single piece of Mandy’s hair. Thank god I wore perfume. I kept zoning out in Margaritas. Thanks Chase for the 2 drinks. You got my back every single time. Ben, don’t shy away from the camera please. Your singing is one of a kind. Sanju, I don’t know how you played that word game when you were tipsy. I guess chem majors are legends of another kind.

<h3>Fked-up Friday</h3> 
Woke up for the code review. When the professor asked “A global exception handler? Why do you need that?” Dead silence among the 4 of us, with me breaking the silence saying “I don’t know…” and bursting into an inappropriate, hysterical laughter. So inappropriate that I need to mute myself because biting my tongue and pinching myself stopped working. Prof asked again about how much of the server code we wrote by ourselves, and I successfully muted myself right after saying “I forgot.” Ended up getting feedback saying that “you even have a front end”, our work is “excellent” and “above and beyond the requirement.” I guess that is why I slept safe and sound for another 3 hours and woke up at 3 pm, seeing the soccer coach texting me asking how do I want to get the $100 cash.

Went out for dinner and karaoke because we did not want to be “locked in” inside the Prospect Hill. Glad we had some prospect at least. Walked too much in Prudentials, shoveled Watty into Aritzia for a proud lap, accidentally went into the men’s bathroom, and had a lot of fun in the Karaoke, including seeing puke all over in the girls’ bathroom. Pierce was in a choir before? Dame it. I guess I can only steal his thunder by singing Chinese songs that nobody except Watty can understand. Drove Watty’s car for a good 10 minutes on campus after dropping PG and MAX off. Fellas, I did great. I will absolutely NOT drive the van next year. That’s saving 10 lives, aka doing God’s work. But actually, self-attesting moment. Not bad.

Went back to the dorm. After having an intellectual conversation with my dear friend OpenAI and 3 failures of deployment, our wicky-ass game Dominion is live on this website:

Group b, I love you simply too much. 3 am. 3 am went into 4 am, and 4 am went into 5 am. The sun was rising. I closed the shade. Go to bed bro. Your liver needs some salvation. And I did. 

<h3>Soothing Saturday</h3> 
Woke up at 11 am. Studied C for a couple of hours on and off, and here we are. Seeking comfort from OpenAI again. And this is to be continued.
