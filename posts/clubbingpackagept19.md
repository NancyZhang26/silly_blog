<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

I don’t particularly like this clubbing experience, but I need to write about it to clear it out of my head.

<h3>How It Went</h3>

I want things to go perfectly. If there were accidents, let them be dramas and fun stories to share. It just didn’t go the way that I wanted it to. I kept thinking, is it because I picked the wrong club, or I wasn’t behaving right? I don’t even know how to phrase it.

I felt like I was making Froggie uncomfortable in some sense, but I thought I was just being me, as in acting silly without thinking. I like the openers, not necessarily the main DJ DANNIC. He is cool, but maybe we were both tired, so we left early.

The part that triggered me the most is when Froggie told me he was “chasing the dragon,” referencing his last summer concert.

The artist of that concert was not particularly my type. I vibe with him, but I don’t fuck with him (lol). I know there is no need for a perfect sync because it is basically impossible for two people to have 100% matching tastes. But I am still sad I couldn’t be the one bringing the fun. I felt like I was a bummer. I can never match the people with whom he raved in the past who provided him with the ultimate euphoric experience.

…

The next morning, I woke up and realized it might be just the alcohol fucking me up. I didn’t drink much. I had at most 3 shots spanned across a whole evening. But I slept like shit. My head ached, and I was so hungry (just a girl). I kept waking up and falling half asleep. On repeat, till 11 am.

We went out for brunch. It was Thai. I felt significantly better. So… Is being emotional just a reaction to chemical imbalances in one’s body? Humans are so fragile.

Also I am a bit scared of alcohol right now. Never take the blames to your drinks!

I am glad to balance out all the crazy clubbing experiences with some tweaks. Time to lock in! Classes and tennis are coming. This post will remind me to lock in.
