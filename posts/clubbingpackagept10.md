<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Boston cruise from 7-9:30 pm, onwards till 2 am was ***fucking magical.***

<h3>Seaport, Overpriced Cisco Beer Hoodie</h3>

I kept walking eastwards again. I was pretty surprised that ***a direction idiot like me*** could remember the path to the seaport and [the Cisco Beer market.](https://www.instagram.com/ciscobrewersseaport/)

<small>Crowded!</small>

Unlike last time, the open market was crowded. I pulled out my passport to the bouncer again. ***It’s a passport sir.*** I tried to capture an eyebrow fling. They always do that, 7/10 times.

A crop hoodie was cute, but ***70 dollars?*** I left the market ***ASAP.***

<h3>CVS</h3>

I don’t know where I want to go. Some drunk kids were roaming the streets. The late-night breeze was tender. I was tipsy after 2 tequila shots and 1 vodka drink — vodka, water, lime. That’s all. ***I walked zig-zag into CVS*** because I am out of trash bags. I did not find anything I wanted. Back on the street again.

I guess ***I am one of the drunk kids*** now, and ***I felt safe that way.***

<small>Didn't make this up.</small>

<h3>Maddy, and His Street Karaoke</h3>

It was outside a Starbucks building IRCC, I heard some speakers banging […Baby One More Time](https://open.spotify.com/track/3MjUtNVVq3C8Fn0MP3zhXa?si=dc3a05155ddb46ef), and being the music major that I am, I ***HAVE TO*** check this out.

I crossed the street to the source of Britney Spears — It was a street karaoke hosted by a musician. ***White hair*** that’s slightly greasy, ***thin ponytail,*** street style ***shirt unbuttoned,*** old boots, ***shiny guitar,*** graffiti-style mini ad boards, guitar cases sprinkled with tips, and most importantly, ***kind of unserious, kind of not sober.***

A lady was singing Britney Spears’s go-to hits. That guitarist was jamming in the background. Fire combo. They are both in love with their jobs.

I had to cue a song and show off ***how one can leverage some drunkness for auditory disaster.***

Interestingly, I was not socially awkward at all this time because I stopped caring. I asked if I could sing [Viva La Vida](https://open.spotify.com/track/1mea3bSkSGXuIRvnydlB5b?si=0eccc4b05a8840c7). The guitarist nodded. ***His eyes were cloudy blue.*** I smelled ***loneliness,*** or is that just me trying to build a character?

I asked the guitarist to take some short videos for me… And he took ***a whole 3 minutes of me screaming and singing in my drunk ass…*** It was not until I got home that I realized ***how killa-drunk I looked.*** There were strangers taking videos of me, too. Jesus Christ! Cringe alert.

It was so ***stress-relieving in an eye-opening way.*** Seeing people living outside of their identities was refreshing.

When I finished singing the last line of lyrics, I lost my voice, and a guy in the crowd said — ***OH SHE IS SO DRUNK.***

Not that much buddy.

I prompted this guy and his friends to sing [Hotel Room Service](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Rb0ptOEjBjPPQUlQtQGbL?si=15faeb555f4f46b9) — my GOD, ***it was so bad that it was so good.*** The girl was reading out “That kinky stuff, you nasty but I like your type” ***like poetry,*** and the guy started saving the scene by ***summoning his inner party MC voice.*** I was laughing so hard that I bent over because my stomach was hurting. Oh my god, man it was fun.

<small>Legendary Hotel Room Service Dual.</small>

As the iconic Hotel Room dual left, I went up again. I sang [The Spins](https://open.spotify.com/track/7BcOUi4FQ3wBLmNTW0yfCR?si=efa01336d7f746f7). I was thinking about that night when I was vibing with Rebecca in Daniel’s basement.

Among the scattered watchers, I spotted someone familiar — It was Moses from the seaport Cisco Beer market last week. Dude. How small is Boston? Why are you here again? I live here. Right, the pharmaceutical company.

He said, yep, ***we just do this every Friday!*** We absolutely planned it out last week already.

I said, you should go sing up there!

Nah. Moses shook his head. People want to see sexy girls singing. Ain’t no one wants to see this — he pointed at himself — over there!

Bro, if you wanna go, just go up there and have fun!

He still smiled and said nah.

We did a very hip-hop handshake, and he left.

The crowd came and went. A gigantic group of drunk kids sang [Dancing Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/0GjEhVFGZW8afUYGChu3Rr?si=1aea092e21b94c57) while ***dancing like kings and queens.*** It looks like a tightly-knit college friend group enjoying some city madness.

I started chatting with the guitarist. What’s your name? How long have you been hosting this? Do you promote yourself? Are you always here?

….

His name is ***Maddy.*** Maddy thinks hosting the street karaoke ***freed him from doing mass job applications.*** Maddy was super into rock n’ roll and bands, but now he was forced to know all the pop songs cuz of this karaoke thing. Maddy’s dream job would involve ***interacting with animals.*** He said one of his favorite past jobs was being a dog walker. Sometimes, he sends quick voice messages saying, ***“Baby, I love you,”*** probably to his significant other, in a ***soft tone*** I never imagined could come from such a chaotic street artist.

Maddy was frequently ***smokin***g with a tiny green bong as people went on and off between songs. He said, ***well I need to take a hit,*** and he took a hit, and I would smell burnt weed, and I started having ***flashbacks of my Brandeis shenanigans.***

I started wondering what is going on inside his head, and ***I wanted to read him.*** I hung out with him since then, going on in front of the mic when nobody is around. We would sing songs together: ***me being the dramatic lead singer, he the sneaky chorus.***

We sang [Shape of you](https://open.spotify.com/track/7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3?si=493407916dd64c0e) and [Beggin’](https://open.spotify.com/track/74nEGIzIefJhJ5qX7NeIAz?si=2a0ecef85ef14d91), in which we were definitely tripping!

Every time the crosswalk light in front of us turned green, I started singing and goofing to draw some attention from the upcoming crowd. People would ***record us, join us, high-five us…*** I hope Maddy was having a good time too. It seemed like it. Maddy would voluntarily ask me, what do I want to sing next, and try to find a song that we both know.

In my [My Heart Will Go On](https://open.spotify.com/track/33LC84JgLvK2KuW43MfaNq?si=22bee385ed284aff) monologue, a girl got me on her phone camera for almost the full song. She told me, you did great!

Thank you girl. I hope one day in different parts of the world, when people randomly scroll through their album, they will see me singing off-tune on the Boston street, and they will laugh and say, ***remember that time…***

Another guy passed by and asked if he can play Maddy’s guitar.

***“My thousand-dollar guitar?”*** Maddy seemed slightly offended, but he quickly hid it behind a harmless joke, ***“Are you gonna tip me?”***

The guy said, of course. Then he put some wrinkled dollar bills inside Maddy’s guitar case. He took the colorful, shiny guitar and started singing softly. Maddy was, again, smoking in the background.

…

The night was not young anymore. Now it was just me, Maddy, and the neon lights, with a few passengers donating some kindness through a gaze or two.

We were yelling — “Thank you Boston!” “Boston I love you!” “How are you Boston?” ***”Boston, make some noise!”***

“Let’s make some noise for …… ***Nancy!***”

“Woah woah wooooah let’s make some noise for ***Maddy*** over here!”

And Maddy would ***smile with his cloudy blue eyes closing up like two new moons.***

When we were singing [Poker Face](https://open.spotify.com/track/5R8dQOPq8haW94K7mgERlO?si=c5acba1029804ad1), a lady stopped by and said, ***“You’re that girl who was dancing on the cruise! Girl, you can sing too?”*** I started sweating because I did not think my horrendous dance moves would be noticeable on the cruise. That’s why they were horrendous! The lady has an exotic accent. I think ***she might be European.***

Before I even realized, it was past 12 am. Maddy’s speakers were dying, and he said he would wrap things up after one last song. He said he wants to sing [Toxic](https://open.spotify.com/track/6I9VzXrHxO9rA9A5euc8Ak?si=c3c1dc45dfe34387) with me because the vibe was so fun.

So we sang Toxic, and Maddy started wrapping up his things.

It was around 12:15, but my night ended around 2 am.

Till next time …
