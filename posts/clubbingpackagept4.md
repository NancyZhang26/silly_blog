<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Out in the-, out in the-, out in the-, out in the-. Out in the street, they call it mer...ther!!

<h3>Mau P</h3>

[Merther](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WBeUXMYcRePMS2DwaNwUD?si=69a7ed8e900845a4). [Mau P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau_P) is here. That man was wearing a black shirt, top buttons off. He was just there. ***<u>Mau P was just there.***</u> Alone, with 2-3 cameramen, in front of the DJ deck. ***<u>Just a Mau P DJing.***</u>

<small>Just a Mau P DJing.</small>

The big screens were zooming in on his post covers and logo. There were no words. I kept thinking why ravers include people of all ages coming from every possible background. It was just some sheer freedom where you jump without identities.

Froggie said, ***<u>how can someone be good-looking, smart, and successful at the same time?***</u> Something is wrong. Yes, Maurice West is a beautiful man with some beautiful styles. I think he is maybe just a little bit freaky. ***<u>Tell me who the fuck samples from PornHub in [Your Mind Is Dirty](https://open.spotify.com/track/7B69sTCwpJdVtoe6WwMc5q?si=0346c99d74d647c6)?***</u> And why are the goods drugs from Amsterdam but not sketchy places in New York? Tell me and nobody will be guilty. ***<u>Isn’t raving just a big group of freaks celebrating existence by wearing fine attire and throwing dollar bills?***</u> I think Mau P built a great stage personality. I kept telling Froggie Mau P should start shaving because I want that rebellious, teenage-looking face back. Froggie just laughed.

Back to the question of ***<u>how the mighty creator distributes perfect packages for a jack of all trades.***</u> The world setting might be buggy. Something is wrong. Wrong indeed, because I could not feel my heart anymore. The kids around us were smoking. ***<u>The minty burnt cigarette smells so familiar.***</u> So many people are vaping. Smoke coming from joints, rolled cigs, and electric tubes blended in and disappeared with numerous inhales. ***<u>Quitting vapes is one of the best decisions I have ever made.***</u>

[Merther](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WBeUXMYcRePMS2DwaNwUD?si=1da39d491cf44bd3), [Beats from the Underground](https://open.spotify.com/track/62bjfb5YMLvZU44vfjJVxp?si=25d553cce1f84379) — ayo get it Mau P!! SexyBack remix, [Gimme that Bounce](https://open.spotify.com/track/7jURkEKDVEm9sHueqUX0ko?si=784318d1579145b7), [People Talk People Sing](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HAflwKirsoDsun2cOIBvx?si=e039130c5b3142ed) -- People talk and people sing and in the end it is just a game, [Drugs from Amsterdam](https://open.spotify.com/track/0w7JPlp7eEQI2EKW3ayXrv?si=c42be388207f4514), Sexy Chick mix, [The Less I Know The Better](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lDGg8CFySbkKUrjgzcLlY?si=842d2cc517a443ec). God, Mau P. Alumni David told me, ***<u>to be a well-known DJ, you need to produce bangers.***</u> Now the bangers are banging. ***<u>The lyrics are coming from flesh built in different heights, races, genders, and sobriety.***</u> But one thing in common, ***<u>we all surely know some Mau P, and we know you got your drugs from Amsterdam.***</u>

Thank you Mau P. I will willingly do a lot of overtime and drop some dollar bills to see you pull some rizz above a gigantic crowd again.

<h3>Girls Help Girls</h3>

***<u>My top kept falling off.***</u> I was jumping up and down like a monkey while trying to hold the girls from popping out. God. Mau P finished his set. Froggie and I went out of the plaza to cool down from the heat. But I heard [Appetite](https://open.spotify.com/track/6zldvnVMC25b4uliSKO9Lz?si=ca2138ca69d64255). My Shaylas. ***<u>It was the hand flicking visuals. It is THE FISH. FISHER IS HERE.***</u>

My whole house addiction started when Jack played [Danielle(Smile On My Face)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2sLVs5iX0osogh4jcsAJkv?si=3955469d27954436) outside of Rosie. I was triple-crossed, and Fred Again opened a new door. And Ken introduced me [Somebody](https://open.spotify.com/track/0agQ9vIV7NP4dntGKLcCXO?si=f5776ecbefee4888), and there started my whole mixing journey and a fanatic passion for House music. Everything is so seductive and pure at some point. ***<u>Fisher, Chris Lake, Dom Dolla, John Summit, Odd Mob, MEDUZA, Mau P.***</u>  as my daylight saviors and filled up my midnight dreams. ***<u>I think humans live on addictions. Being either substance, other people, or personal endeavors. Just pleasure in its transpositions.***</u> I don’t know how to classify House Music. I felt it deeply. I wanna dance to it while dreaming. The best reality escapers, but it is so real and down-to-earth.

I deviated. Apologies. I saw Fisher, and ***<u>Froggie and I were running towards the plaza again,***</u> just as we were running in the Grand Central Station under the clear blue dome, running to find the VIP area, and running towards Mau P. Dunno about Froggie, but ***<u>I felt like 2 free birds.***</u> I felt so free when we were running. ***<u>We were running like 2 kids in async.***</u>

Yes, we were running. I was running. ***<u>My jeans tube top was dropping like a broken elevator.***</u> I an definitely showing my bra. I would say sorry, but I figured maybe it is what people like to see. Either way, I was pretty embarrassed but I had no room for girly thoughts because Fisher is here.

In a short distant, ***<u>a girl yelled at me with eyes full of unbelieveness: “Girl FIX YOUR BOOBS!”***</u>

So I fixed them.

<h3>Fisher</h3>

<small>The Fish is fishing</small>

That is me seeing this man for the second time. The first time was in an 18+ club in Boston in November 2024. I was with Mandy and Becca, and it was where [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TvrpSSP5bBAmwhA9gZCapdpAe9sZH1wW/view?usp=drivesdk) marvelous documentation got released.

But this time, I assume I know him more. I played every single one of his sets that I can find on YouTube. I am well aware of all of his transitions, his preference for playing what songs after the next, his dance moves, his famous flicks, his silly-boooo visuals, his crazy charisma. Now he has dropped the new bangers [Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jhAJgaS9OttFwP5Cn8WII?si=d6e28aec9ad64e49) in November 2024 (time flies!) and [Stay](https://open.spotify.com/track/74y1VgzL668hynrvA59WQB?si=87d75f42b8ae40b6) this year. If anything can hype me up more than [Somebody](https://open.spotify.com/track/0agQ9vIV7NP4dntGKLcCXO?si=f5776ecbefee4888), I would dance to [Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jhAJgaS9OttFwP5Cn8WII?si=d6e28aec9ad64e49) all day.

And he did play Ocean. ***<u>That ID was so pure.***</u> At some moments I felt like me, Froggie, the kid sucking a joint, the girl passing vapes with her girlie group, the 6’6 possibly finance guy, have known each other forever. [It’s That Time](https://open.spotify.com/track/3GiORO0zRwRT3g9CCklzkQ?si=8f4c7f47b8e94968)! ***<u>Within a seeable range, people went bonkers.***</u> I went bonkers. I was looking at videos from last night. Bro why do I look like that. Did I just rave with that melting eye shadow and messy hair and chapped lips? No. That is the vibe.

[Atmosphere](https://open.spotify.com/track/63HwAAXuSV2tzIUPoHOwZa?si=507d8a90a6764622), [Losing It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ho0GyrWZN3mhi9zVRW7xi?si=e7223a743ee948d0), [Somebody](https://open.spotify.com/track/0agQ9vIV7NP4dntGKLcCXO?si=f5776ecbefee4888) (of course). All the well-known bangers.

[Take It Off!](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zp9FOU4cjFdGN1zdWTvcB?si=3a1e5cb5c54b4e03) In the video I recorded, ***<u>Froggie and I are vibing back to back like 2 decent ravers,***</u> and a girl shouted ***<u>“take your mtrfking clothes off!”***</u> Woah, chill, not right here! But I guess if you do, people will only cheer.

[World, Hold On](https://open.spotify.com/track/6quGF3Kvzd5WYEEuCmvCe1?si=2e66cf41af004d44)! I knew Fisher is going to do the same [low-frequency cut](https://youtu.be/PNPpSPS1nok?si=NiQs5oHYaiwUBxbg&t=3661) that he has been doing in every single set. He did it. ***<u>World, hold the fuck on!***</u> The crowd went nuts.

Just Dance remix? This is so fratty. I wonder what the Fish is like in college. His whole thing is so silly. ***<u>It was an alpha silly.***</u> Froggie asked me, ***<u>do you think Fisher would annoy you if you were friends in real life?***</u> Yes I think he will. I think a person is not truly funny if he is not annoying. I read on Reddit that someone said Fisher copies other people’s homework in school. No proof. Just saying. Not slandering! ***<u>But who cares?***</u> I am so drawn by his tracks and rizz that I was almost thinking of buying those crazy over-priced merch on his site.

Fisher ended the set with an ID I wasn’t familiar with. ***<u>I was almost holding a grudge if I couldn’t tell the upcoming song within the first 3 seconds after he started mixing the low bass.***</u> I can transcribe every single bass line in his every single song. I am proud to say that I think I know Fisher’s art pretty well. I knew he is going to play something similar to his 2025 EDC sets, and he is. I try to read his stage personality, and I love how in some set videos, ***<u>he got blown away by the unbelievable crowd energy, the so-called collective consciousness?***</u> In such a way people are connected by flows and mutual appreciations. ***<u>So was Fisher holding crowd control power through he flicks?***</u> I think so, and I think it is so powerful. I could only touch upon a millionth of it by playing 2010 top hits in AEPi. I hope, and I will produce some better tracks. I hope to go B2B with Fisher. In my dreams. Who knows.

One more song. One more song. Nope. Fisher left, and the stage was playing [The Spins](https://open.spotify.com/track/7BcOUi4FQ3wBLmNTW0yfCR?si=414e545eae9240c3). Froggie and I sat down on a corner with Kygo going on next. He played Gimme Gimme! remix and some more melodic-based traditional EDM, I would say. Did he even play Avicci? [Wake Me Up,](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nrRP2bk19rLc0orkWPQk2?si=a92fdff92d0b4f60) if I remembered correctly. We spent a short while in silence because we were both so exhausted. ***<u>It was ~30k steps plus a 3-hour ride with some alc and some screaming and jumping, and 3 hours coming ahead to take us back to Manhattan.***</u> City never sleeps, but I do need to sleep on the shuttle.

<h3>I Survived My Trip To NYC</h3>

Some drunk people were talking BS in the back. It was all very fratty. One guy said ***<u>the last time he showered was this Thursday.***</u> Good for you?

Didn’t talk much on the way back. ***<u>My throat is burning, and I could barely open my eyes.***</u> We took the subway back. American history reveals itself a little in the subway. The subway station smelled like bathrooms. In this sense, ***<u>does history smell like bathrooms?***</u> Physical histories are histories, too. This is gross, but silly-funny.

My stop arrived first. So I said bye to Froggie. As the subway door closed, I could only see him through the glass. I walked in the opposite direction of the subway, and I caught him looking at me through the crowd. I think I was both tired and scared of leaving those peak memories in Long Island. I think I might look confused or extra quiet. Or not. I bent over to sneak a peek at him one last time. Caught you!

I went back to Avalon. Spent 30 minutes sitting on the ground, checking videos, and zoning out. ***<u>Everything was too good be true.***</u> The sprakling moments I thought people are connected and got each other. ***<u>The rides. The bass. The fire. The blinding ferris wheel. The Hamptons.***</u>

The peak was so peak that the normal feels low. I think I would need a few days to cool down. Those after-party disappointment feels so real, and ***<u>it reminds me that I am alive.***</u> All the moments of contrast reminds me that I am living a non-simulated life. Streets in NY are like ***<u>LEGO puzzles being stacked together just to fit all the spaces, both horizontally and vertically, and somehow they have some aesthetics,***</u> which could potentially be confusing, I guess. But I am seeing everything real.

I took a shower and passed out on the bed.

I woke up, packed up, ordered a Uber share to the bus station because my lame ass was lazy. Got there late for 8 minutes and ***<u>there were no buses.***</u> Just an empty road under the highway pillars. I have no one else to blame but me. ***<u>I walked around randomly under the drizzle.***</u> I left the keys in Avalon, so ***<u>I have no place to go to.***</u> I was suddenly thinking about Brandeis. I miss my dorm. ***<u>I sat down on my suitcase in a street corner under the roof and had the team call.***</u> I tried to be serious, ***<u>but everything coming out of my mouth turns into jokes.***</u> I was telling my teammates about how that girl reminded me to ***<u>“fix my boobs”***</u> instead of showing everybody my bra. I said the word “bra” and “boobs” loud and clear in front of ***<u>3 strangers***</u> who walked passed my face. Again, no body cares, but I like being dramatic.

I went to a cafe to sober up a bit and wrote this post before it sank down into my subconscious. I then walked ~30 mintues to the new bus station for the 1pm bus that I just booked. I got on the bus safely this time, sitting with a stranger because it was a fully-booked bus. I was typing in my notes app right now to wrap up the final traces as the stranger on my right was sipping something like chocolate milk. I wanna have a sip of that so bad, but I left in a hurry, and I forgot my water bottle at Avalon.

![Me In NY...](/img/palm_tree/me_in_ny.jpg)
<small>See you in Boston.</small>

But ***<u>at least I am not walking on the bare street in rain and calling my teammates in street corners anymore.***</u> So peace out NY. Thanks for having me.
