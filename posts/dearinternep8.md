Dear Jiayi,

Cutting off vaping and smoking are 2 of the best things I have done this year. For once in forever, I feel like high school again. There is so much going on in my head right now, and I need to let it out, or else I feel dizzy!

It is not even anything meaningful, just a compilation of moments and snapshots. No logic included by any means. The back of my head feels numb. So numb! I don't know what to do.

I was reading wang zhen's gong zhong hao on WeChat. ***He has got a full ocean in his heart.*** I think all writers have either too much romance or ambition that needs to come out through pen or keyboard. And if those mind chunks can be appreciated, they get a prize called the Nobel. 

I cannot study philosophy or liberal arts forever, now in the sense that, not because I think my brain will become rusty, but because ***I don't think I can handle the high-intensity streams of thinking.*** I would get lost in snapshots, and go live in a mountain by myself.

The human brain is such an amazing creation. Don't dehumanize it. Don't robotify it. Don't put a chip in it that simplifies things. I feel it in my bones that I want to be vulnerable and real, and that is the perfect setting for a normal, ordinary human like me.

Please bear with my naive sentiments. ***One of the best romances in life is realizing that you are nobody in the scope of many things, yet still trying to worship yourself and respect life to the fullest.***

I am hungry,
Nancy Zhang
