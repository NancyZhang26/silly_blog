<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

Woke up by my alarm and jumped right up from bed. Any seconds of hesitation would be a disrespect to my summer.

<h3>Adios, Deis.</h3>

5 AM departure to Logan Airport. My suitcase was 51 lb —- ***<u>1 lb over the allowed limit.***</u> The lady checking my bag was sassy af. She was like Girl, 1 pound overweight is a ***<u>100-dollar fine.***</u>

You gotta be kidding me.

I stuffed my headphones and bed sheets (because I will be sleeping on the floor) in my backpack and put on a resting bitch face that was enhanced by my 2-hr sleep. Luckily, ***<u>I passed the bag check, passed the security, and passed out on the plane.***</u>

<h3>Heller LA.</h3>

The flight was fine, except that my stomach was growling when I got off. Six whole hours, and I fell asleep without even adjusting the seat to lean backwards.

Saw a Dunkin right after spending quite a fortune buying overpriced coffee and a sandwich in some bougie airport place. It’s whatever.

***<u>…And the Zhangs united!***</u>

Didn’t see Jiayi for a long while, but ***<u>it feels like yesterday.***</u>

Spent lots of time cooking + bed rotting + acting silly. ***<u>It’s the best.***</u> THE ABSOLUTE BEST!

<h3>I’m a NARP</h3>

***<u>Non-Athletic-Regular-Person.***</u>

Anyhow, I am still at the phase in which I gag whenever I see a tennis court, so I opened VS Code. ***<u>If I am too lazy to shovel my ass into the gym, let’s at least do something intellectually challenging.***</u> So I challenged myself by giving detailed operation orders to multiple LLM models = copy + pasting from ChatGPT and Claude 3.7. My besties!

I do feel sad, as if I lost something without playing tennis or hitting the gym. I am having insomnia regularly, and 30% of my day is spent in brain fog. Information overload, but where is the information?

I have this fear of not working out for 1 day will put my fitness back to cavemen level. Maybe cavemen is not a good word because those homosapiens (correct me Max) are athletic for life. This fear is constantly stretching my mental rubber band and finally it is now on the verge of popping.

POP.

But I guess the Cali sun never fails you. Zoning out in UCLA is a vibe, and ***<u>Jiayi is cooking for me all the time***</u> (at the cost of me doing web scraping for her. I’m not a leech!).

It’s fine. One goes lie into a box in the end anyway. I can spend some time lying in bed for a warm-up. Nothing has really changed ever since I started the new hobby of bed rotting. I kind of need those moments.

Also, I give out a high-pitched, annoying laugh every hour when I was with Jiayi. ***<u>Laughing is healthy!***</u> I was laughing like a mtrfker when Jiayi burped in class, when Jiayi’s cat punched + bit my feet (because they STINK), when the instagram reels hit hard at 11 pm, and when ***<u>that sausage dog was so excited to see us that she started peeing in our friend’s living room and we were wondering why our shoes feel sticky.***</u>

Laugh more!
