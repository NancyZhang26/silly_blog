<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

It was under the cortesy of ***Professor Chandler Rosenberger,*** and of course, my beloved sister Jiayi, who planed out the entire weekend for me. Now as I was recovering from the Goldfish mini rave, ***a boat club seems way too classy*** for me. Do people just sit under an umbrella, drink tea together, and talk about their kids and trust fund?

Anyways, road trip starts now. It was a ***3-hour ride*** to Chandler’s club in the cape. You know, as the ***passenger princess*** I am actually quite busy. Cuing songs, checking maps, handing (feeding) over snacks. But since I am not the person driving, I shouldn't complain at all.

Near the center of the parking lot, we see ***a happy friendly Chandler*** waving at us as directing us to pull over. We reached!

<h3>Motorboat</h3>

First stop is the ***motorboat.*** Chandlar was driving. We were all wearing ***safety vests like good elementary kids.*** The motorboat was sprinting on the sea. Snow-white waves splashing on the brim of the boat. The engine was roaring like a beast. I smelled gasoline. Chandlar was steadily navigating the directions. At some moment I thought he looked like ***Posaidon.***

<small>Chill.</small>

I reached out my hand towards the sea and there it was. ***Water!*** I know I should touch more grass but I guess ***touching some water is not too bad.*** Cold. Flowing. ***Emotionless but full of motion.*** Now I am just inventing words.

I like when the splash of sea hits my face and rinses my clothes. It makes me feel connected with nature.

As we got out of the boat, Chandler taught us how to tie ***a sailor’s knot*** to make sure the boat does not escape with the waves. The knot looks like an infinity symbol, which I found ***weirdly romantic.***

I also found all elements related to sea adventure somehow attractive. A boat; an anchor. It is so much freedome at the risk of being borderless.

<h3>Lunch</h3>

Now let's talk about "clubs". A club that is somehow similar to the one in [The Summer I Turned Pretty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Summer_I_Turned_Pretty_(TV_series)) Young waitor and waitresses wearing white uniforms decorated with light blue. Everything seems so fresh. So was the food. Simple and fresh. Jiayi got lobster roll, and I got a shrimp salad. There was only 1 chef today, who put a sign in the parking lot saying, ***“No chef, no food!”*** So we waited for a while, during which we had some really intellectual conversations with Chandler and his beautiful family.

His son Silas in Junior high school is going to apply for college soon. Me and Jiayi both agreed that ***he is going to break a lot of hearts*** in the future. His daughter is still in 9th grade, but quote from Silas, “can’t wait to go to college and be away from her parents.”

And now we are heading off with Chandler to the beach.

<h3>Beach</h3>

<small>Jeeeeep.</small>

Chandler drove us around a bit in his ***OG mini Jeep,*** the kind that you need to push the front seats over in order to make room for the back. It was a little ***red car,*** with its outside covered in mud, and inside sprinkled with sand. ***It roared with its miniature lungs.*** Cutie. It took Chandler, Jiayi, and I into classy local places. A tennis club hidden behind a inner road labeled ***“Forehand Drive.”***

A cinema with handwritten signs. The next movie coming up is F1. Intimidating!

I say the most impressive scenary was the beach. Us three had to walked over a long beachy area on bare feet. It wasn’t purely beach, but ***a mixture of sandy piles, clear shallow water filtering spiky seaweeds laying on the shore, and cages for trapping oysters.*** Don’t touch them. You would get shot! Seriously.

Near the oyster trappers, the sand were more solid like wind-dried mud, but not as gross. In fact it was the complete opposite definition from gross. It reflects a weirdly mysterious purple.

“It makes me feel surreal. Sorry. I should have found a better way phrasing that.”

Chandler shook his head and said, No! He totally gets it. ***When things are elementy, it pulls you away from real life for a bit.*** FYI the purple was probably some algae.

Those algae reminded me of the inside of a clam shell under certain light reflection angles. Not specifically a color, but a mixture of ***metal-like wavelengths.*** It was the frequencies again. In my humble opinion, ***resonance is key. The beach was resonating with us beautifully.*** We were immersed with the purple, even if it seems a bit out of context for a chill beach tour.

As we were walking through the low tides, we felt wrinkles on the sand. Almost solid wrinkles, which did not disperse with our steps. I know what it is. It is ***the shapes of the waves.*** Ocean’s knotted thoughts, as Chandlar phrased it. It would be the key word of the day. ***Ocean’s knotted thoughts.*** Later, when Jiayi retrieved this term from the texts, we were both amazed by Chandler’s ***romantic analogy*** behind his scholarly suits. We were all in sinking our feet in the water. ***Below ankles, we were all naked like children, and we were reading ocean’s knotted thoughts without blockers.***

<small>Ocean's knotted thoughts, if you see it.</small>

We started popping jokes. Maybe ***the sandy wrinkles can be seen as the ocean’s brain.*** In that case, the ocean is truly wise based on those folds. I proposed. ***“An MRI scan of the ocean!”*** Chandler laughed. We all laughed. So there was loads of sand, but where are the sand castles? Where are the sculptures? Probably hit by the waves and now they are all debris. I said, I once remembered that, because many people found their snowmen destroyed by ill-intentioned cars, ***they started building snowmen around fire hydrants.*** Chandler burst into a very infectious laughter. Imagine the car wreck!

<h3>Tennis</h3>

Getting back from the beach we played some entertainment tennis in the club. Sunsets and chill tennis. Maybe I don’t dislike this sports that much. It was just some bonding experiences for us. Me, Jiayi, Silas, and Chandler. We had fun.

<h3>Heading Back</h3>

Lots of walking. Lots of driving. We went to a good Korean restaurant in Allston. Yum.

<small>Jiayi is so cute.</small>

We reached Malden around 12 am. Our neighbors were having a movie night. ***They projected the entire movie canvas on the HOUSE.*** Yep that’s it. ON THE HOUSE, like on the entire front surface of the architecture itself. I wish I took a photo. It was so summer. Just summer.

***“Ocean’s knotted thoughts…”***
