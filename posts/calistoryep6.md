<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

Don't run GIT commands unless you know what you're doing...

<h3>Don’t Trust GitHub Desktop … or Me</h3>

I tried to clone my new git repo to my desktop again, and the system said it was confused as the new repo name was the same as that of a project I deleted a few minutes ago. I deleted and recreated with the same repository name because I messed up some initialization config at first.

And ***<u>my desktop icons started deleting in chunks as I rapidly breathed in extreme fear.***</u>

A few seconds later. ***<u>There was nothing left.***</u>

My 3 years of academic struggles, personal jargon, and music shits. ***<u>Gone.***</u> All gone.

I don’t know what to say since my fingers were trembling with despair, and I know I should have learned OS better for this. What kind of cloud operation was it? Github? Or just me being too stupid to name 2 projects with the exact same name?

I instantly navigated to my iCloud desktop folder on my phone and ***<u>sent the whole thing to Jiayi VIA IMESSAGE. 60GB of data via iMessage.***</u> That was an involuntary struggle. What was I, a dumbass?? I don’t have a hard drive with me, and why didn’t I listen to my dad when he said to keep a physical backup of my data? I mean I did but the fking drive is in China. God forbid this.

I was shaking as if I had just inhaled a can of coffee beans. I navigated to my settings to turn off the Document and Finder synchronization to prevent the deletion from spreading to all my cloud devices. Ok now it’s off, and ***<u>I continued to shiver in utter silence at 4 am.***</u>

The birds were chirping. It was 5 am. The sky turned baby blue, and I was staring at my empty desktop. Yep, I know I should start downloading files from my cloud storage ASAP, but I was just so shocked and astonished by my stupidity. ***<u>I was mortified.***</u>

Sort of did everything while shivering due to the lack of sleep later. I finally started restoring files in a UCLA classroom.

Jiayi and I were sitting in the back rows ***<u>watching some people online shopping and others being studious.***</u> It was something like a literature + philosophy class, and the prof mentioned “Harry Potter’ at least 5 times. I like Harry Potter.

<h3>Error -8062</h3>

I will never forget this error after seeing it at least 20 times today. It often pops up when I try to copy-paste a big folder for the first time. But when I choose to “resume copying” afterwards for 2-3 rounds, the process works out fine.

“***<u>Error -8062***</u> is a macOS file system error that typically happens with:
1. iCloud sync conflicts
2. File metadata issues
3. Large folder operations
4. Mixed file states (some downloaded, some not).”

My desktop folders are so dame big!

Select - right click - repeat… My fingers are definitely bulking after this.

I ended up zipping and unzipping big folders from the cloud to local. It was 20x faster. I was wondering why system designers don’t make the copy-paste process in the same logic as compressing and decompressing zip files. I looked it up, and it seems like the traditional copy-paste operation was preserved under a concern for old legacy machines - what if they don’t support zip files - and the differences between different OSes. Also, it looks like modern cloud operations are already following the trend of compressing data in the background.

Learn by doing!

I checked the git logs again too, and still don’t understand why my desktop got wiped away. But here is the log:

On my way to get some hard drives now. Debating whether I should turn on the files + finder sync again. Later!
