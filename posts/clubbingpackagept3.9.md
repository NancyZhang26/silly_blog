<h3>Check My Internship Shenanigans:</h3>
<a href="{{ '/posts/dearinternep1/' | url }}">Dear Intern ep1. LATE!</a>

<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

I knew I would bring my laptop with me just in case, and in this case, ***<u>missing the 8:30 bus like a champ.***</u> I was sitting on my suitcase in a NY street corner with the drizzle occasionally slipping on my face and calling WTEN for a good 30 minutes.

When I was walking with Froggie, I trust the New Yorker instinct so much ***<u>I was barely thinking.***</u> Now I need to reboot my brain… I got another bus at 1pm and went to a nearby coffee shop, and figured I would write everything down before they fade away.

Walking in the light rain sobers me up a lot, although I proudly said that I think I was decent enough at the rave (or not? Tell me). Why is it always after I washed my hair.

Typing on a computer feels oddly satisfying right now. My wristbands are still on because I would need a pair of scissors to get them off. They just soaked in the rain and are tied hard to my skin, proving that ***<u>yesterday was not a dream.***</u> Aight, I got 3 hours before hopping on the right bus (hopefully) to pull all my memories out.

***<u>It is like a dream come true.***</u> I confidently say that I will remember and maybe shed some lame tears for this day 1 year from now. ***<u>My first music festival and outdoor rave in Long Island.***</u>

<h3>City Never Sleeps</h3>

I was counting minutes when getting out of the office. I need to dip bro, and I did. I thought the bus was 6:30 but it was 7:30. Fast-forward to when I got off this 5-hour bus, finishing a [Fisher set](https://youtu.be/mzArzdY24wU?si=Q-ndARfVWJ0D3Hdz), a [Mau P set](https://youtu.be/WEcImcXf6C0?si=AvAUg3eGHEHLV8Kn), and a [John Summit & Dom Dolla set](https://youtu.be/9ZqJPIbTme4?si=PIaPy-aklGp31ylg).

I was shocked by what I saw. Forgive me for being overdramatic. I have come to NY a couple times before, but never by myself, never at midnight, never carrying butterflies inside me, never panicking about everything up in the air. It is for real the city that never sleeps. ***<u>12:20 am, mid-town Manhattan, neon lights, gigantic display screens built on building walls, food trucks, girls showing skin, boys showing rizz, crackheads, smokers.***</u> As if anything could happen. By anything, I mean everything. As if nobody gives a fuck and you need to drop a little self esteem to truly be free.

I don’t know about dropping anything at first, but ***<u>I just dropped the chicken gyro I bought from the food truck.***</u> All over my top and suitcase. And ***<u>I dropped my self-esteem by calmly wiping them off in the middle of the sidewalk.***</u> Of course nobody gave amy fuck, except this dude who opened a paper bag at me and rambled something that sounds like English but did not make anysense. ***<u>I think he was trying to sell me crack.***</u> Uhh-uh.

I told Steven I would be there in 20 minutes, but I actually took 40 minutes. I felt insanely bad. But… Can someone tell me why there are so many crosswalks to go through, and people never follow the light signal? I finally settled down. So this is what Xinpeng’s room looks like. I saw a lot of memories with Jiayi. That’s cute. Nightly. Can’t wait for tomorrow.

<h3>Pregame on a Shuttle, Chug Chug Chug</h3>

Woke up at 8 am, showered because I need my hair to give a little. 20 minutes before meeting up with Froggie, ***<u>I could not find my press-on nails.***</u> Girl. Wtf.

Found them under the blanket. Tried to put them on. ***<u>Said “fuck” for about 10 times, other miscellanous words for 20 times.***</u> Nails look ok, but nobody told me they would disable my hand from functioning normally. Spare me. I can’t even put on my shoes or tie my hair. Later, one of the nails fell off during the shuttle ride, and all of them fell off during the rave. It was worth it though.

<small>It needs a feature!</small>

I stormed out of the building carrying a paper bag full of shooters and soju. I tried not to make it jingle. But again, nobody cares, but being dramatic is fun.

Froggie and I got Onigiris before getting on the shuttle. We ate them while standing on the sidewalk. We got a shuttle of ravers cruising towards Long Island. As I heard the song [People Talk People Sing](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HAflwKirsoDsun2cOIBvx?si=a7fc8c7136e542f9) banging through the speakers, ***<u>I knew I was on the right shuttle.***</u> Froggie said, “They know their audience!”

There was a girl wearing shawty shorts that said “WAP” on her ___. I couldn’t stop staring.

The shooters started shooting on the shuttle. Tequila and Whiskey are cheaper than therapy. I think I caught the liquor store owner looking at my ___ the other day.

We talked about many things, so the ride felt short. 2 shots inside me. That was nothing. Or was it anything? Why did we start talking about distributed systems, concurrency, and 131 (again?!). I got the top 11 grades in the class?! ***<u>Bro, rizz me UP.***</u> Second-best news behind this rave this summer. I started talking about my internship and throwing technical jargon. ***<u>I was trying too hard to be sophisticated.***</u> Froggie was yawning. The two girls in the front looked back from time to time. It was hilarious in retrospect. I think I need to take more OS classes.

<small>Shooters are shooting. Wouldn't you like to know.</small>

But the bus arrived in the middle of nowhere. I see no DJ booths or anything, because they are 5 minutes walk away silly. So we walked towards the main entrance with the remaining goods jingling in the paper bag. ***<u>More CS content and the socio-economic state of the world.***</u> I think Froggie knows good stuff, and I can only participate by providing emotional values through blinking eyes. The contrast provides top-tier entertainment, and I think laughing > tequila > therapy. And we were there. ***<u>Hamptons, Palm Tree Festival.***</u>

<h3>Girls Hype Girls. Where is the VIP.</h3>

***<u>It is like a dream come true. It is like a dream come true.***</u>

The big banners look exactly like the ticket flyers. I mean, what else are they supposed to look like? But that is my dream for a whole month. Only a month and it is here right in front of my eyes. I was playing Fisher and Mau P sets when I was working, dozing in the office, sending emails, brushing my teeth, running, showering, putting on make-up, being silly in front of the mirror. Now ***<u>they will be right in front of me with hundreds of other ravers.***</u> Man!

<small>Got too excited and lost my face.</small>

We are passing bad checks. The board says “no outside drinks”, but the bag check is so silly. We could have just hidden shooters in our shoes, or my top, if anybody dares to question whether I am fully natural.

Anyways, while advancing in the line, Froggie and I started chugging the last shooter and splitting a bottle of soju.

***<u>“Girl you chug!”***</u> That was girl behind us when I was finishing the soju. ***<u>LMAFO. Girls hype girls***</u> I guess. I gave a tipsy smile at her. I heard her plus one asked her what happened. She said, ***<u>“She (referring to me) took a shot already…”***</u>

Dead, absolutely dead.

And here we are, Froggie and I, and probably thousands of people in this large summer-vibe area. Palm Tree Music Festival. Please explain to me ***<u>why everybody is like 6’6 and wearing an old-money shirt with the top buttons open.***</u> So fratty! The drunk thoughts start kicking in. It was around 2:30 pm, 3-4 hours before Mau P and Fisher start performing. We visited a couple of booths, took some drinks, drank some drinks, and ate some food.

We wanted to go to the VIP area to chill for a bit. But ***<u>this***</u> guard we asked pointed at ***<u>that***</u> guard, and that guard pointed at another guard. Froggie was laughing, saying ***<u>it is funny how the system functions with people having no clue how every sub-section is connected.***</u> I was laughing with him, because at this point I think I will laugh at any living sentences.

<small>VIP?</small>

We got to the VIP area. ***<u>Froggie carried. I was just following him***</u> because I forgot my brain in the paper bag, and ***<u>now the alc is jingling in my head.***</u> Oops.

Please, 4-5 shots are like nothing.More drinks, pizza, and ice cream. Just chilling. So wholesome.
