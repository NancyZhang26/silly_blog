<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Mission accomplished: Didn’t drunk-cry this time! Thanks guys!

<h3>People Drunk-Text, I Drunk-Email</h3>

I brought with me all the alc I sneaked into the borders ***<u>from China.***</u> It was some 40% wheat liquor. I have a tolerance, and ***<u>my chaser is water.***</u>

Nikki’s got a cozy place — a 2-bedroom apartment, decor on wall, TV on play, stuffed animals scattered on the couch. I finished my drinks, and my head was starting to feel numb. We were vibing to some afrobeat house and playing this ***<u>number game***</u>: we count from 1, and the person who gets a multiple of 7 needs to clap instead of counting. The rules will be customized as the game goes on.

The drunkness got me to reveal my ***<u>true self***</u> — I kept ***<u>checking my final grades and Gmail.***</u> I got an email from my COSI 131A (OS: Operating System) TA, Archer, for my PA4 Submission Confirmation?! And he asked ***<u>if I want to be a TA,***</u> and “wouldn’t be asking if he thinks I don’t qualify” — HELLO?!

I’d call that the highlight of tonight (nah). Pierce, do you remember ***<u>how much we suffered in this dame class?***</u> We are like ***<u>2 homeless people who show up to classes and recitations just to vibe***</u> bro. You were always on some ***<u>random ass games,***</u> and I was always submitting my ***<u>AI-generated cover letters.***</u> I never told you there were times when I studied 3-4 hours of OS every day, reading the ***<u>textbook that looked like Latin***</u> for a solid week, along with everything else messy going on. You know it, but ***<u>my test grades have always been mediocre.***</u> I will never get over when you said ***<u>“taking the rear…”***</u> Hell yeah we were taking the rear and vibing in those recitations. Did you finally get your C set up on your PC? Do you still remember ***<u>malloc***</u>? I sure as hell don’t.

I never believed I could be solid in CS classes, but dude, a TA inquiry from a TA who is hella smart? Ok, guys, let’s just pull up to the club with this email tagged on my chest. Your fresh 21-year-old potential OS TA is getting wild with the girls tn.

I used my last bit of sobriety to email Archer back. The sentences were scattered in pieces, but luckily they made sense. Sorry Archer! I checked my grades one more time — ***<u>A-***</u>?! I got an A- for my OS class?! GOD DAME! Guys, I am drinking not to release my stress, but to ***<u>CELEBRATE.***</u> I screamed out loud into Bhakti’s left ear, so loud that I think ***<u>the couch just shivered.***</u>

“What? What??” Chase, Bhakti, Nikki, and Nupur all poked their head towards my phone.

“I got an A- for my OS class!” I don’t remember if I was tearing up, but my voice definitely cracked. I have never felt nerdier, but the girls were hyping me UP. ***<u>Girls help girls, lads.***</u> Girls are the best. Chase said, Nanthy, that's so good!! Bhakti said, Nance, that’s so great! Nikki said, let’s go!

Time for more shots, and I did have more shots.

Ended up spamming Archer with ***<u>two more emails,***</u> including screenshots of my grade and test comments on PA4. It’s ok… At least I’m not sending other things…

<h3>Chilling, but Actually</h3>

We were on the guest list, but the guest list had a line that was even longer than the general admission line. We were shivering in the cold, ***<u>chilling but actually chilling.***</u> I was clinging to Chase’s arm like a keychain. Memories were in pieces. I remember Chase and Bhakti telling me about seeing the Brandeis Soccer Team. Small world, bad luck?

Finally got in. I started running to the bathroom at least 5 times in a row, and that was how I sobered up. Magically, my body just works like that. Ok, now the alc is gone, ***<u>the munchies started coming in.***</u> I was devouring the pretzel I got with Chase. It was so delicious that I started nodding when I ate it. I remember trying to stuff it inside my purse… But why… I guess I was still drunk…

<h3>DJ Played Fisher</h3>

I forgot the name of the club. Grand? Royale? Basement? It was the second club that we went to that night. I was trying to vibe with this DJ. The crowd loved him. However, I was quite unfamiliar with the latest American hip-hop mix. I should expand my scope.

As I was contemplating how I should become ***<u>a walking Spotify master list,***</u> the DJ played Fisher’s [Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jhAJgaS9OttFwP5Cn8WII?si=ba3ea83c22d2498b). Man, I went crazy. I started jumping so hard that I think my elbow hit Bhakti, and she just silently moved to the front — Sorry Bhakti!! ***<u>I was jumping so hard as if I was doing a HIIT workout before the gym closes.***</u> Oh god, hahahaha, I am losing some words right now, because after Ocean, the DJ played [Stay](https://open.spotify.com/track/74y1VgzL668hynrvA59WQB?si=55d0e8c993dd4ad2). 2 Fisher tracks in a row? Sir, ***<u>are we like related or something?***</u> I tried making eye contact with him — you are a fking G!

That was a thing I noticed in most commercial club nights — just ***<u>know the crowd and play some bangers…***</u> Techniques matter, but not that much for a general audience. I hypothesize that everyone has a bit of ego regarding their own playlists. ***<u>Music taste should be diversely neutral, like IDEs!***</u> But we are talking about drunk people here. Raving would be another scope, but long story short, just ***<u>be selfless and serve your daddies and mommies…***</u>

A guy in front of me was holding his phone up, with the screen displaying 4 words:

***<u>John Summit, Zelle 30.***</u>

I was DYING. I felt so bad for the DJ. Some DJs really ***<u>don’t like song requests.***</u> Please don’t ask me why. I was one of the people who annoyed a DJ because I kept asking him to play [Lonely Dance](https://open.spotify.com/track/6XrnEjYDnm9JUeoDE4efvA?si=453aa5ef525743cf). Remember that Jiayi? ***<u>Sweaty Shanghai nights.***</u>

It was 2 am. Suddenly, the lights were all up. Party’s over! ***<u>People left like moths from a flame.***</u> While we were just about to leave, a guy tapped on my shoulder and asked for my name. I think he might have tried to hit on me… Maybe?? One way or the other, I gave him ***<u>my DJ business card.***</u> He seemed very ***<u>confused,***</u> but took it.

I gave my card to the DJ group as well. I have handed out so many cards. 0 response. But that is ok. Trial and error.

Good night!
