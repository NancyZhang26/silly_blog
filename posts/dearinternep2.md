<h3>Last Internship Post:</h3>
<a href="{{ '/posts/dearinternep1/' | url }}">Dear Intern ep1. LATE!</a>

<h3>Main Plot Starts Here:</h3>

***<u>If I use ChatGPT in college, and people use ChatGPT in this company, I think I am meant to be here.***</u>

<h3>Vibe Coding vs. Vibe Choking</h3>

The first meeting with 30+ junior/senior Software Engineers is intimidating in the beginning. The nerves cooled down later, as I realized that I don’t need to say anything other than some self intro (duh), and the leader said with great euphemism that, ***<u>guys, don’t use chatGPT***</u> to code IF you just copy paste directly without understanding what the code is doing - ***<u>“vibe coding”.***</u> Don’t do it.

It was later confirmed by my mentor that some unlucky guys got caught, being unable to explain the code because it was ***<u>AI’s chef kiss.***</u>

<h3>Boss You’re FR</h3>

Bumped into the CTO and the speaker during lunch on the stairs. The CTO asked me about my first official day.

Me trying to be humble: “I learned some insights from the great marketing team.”

He seemed ***<u>unimpressed: “You don’t have to say that…”***</u> He pointed at the speaker who just walked out of the building, ***<u>“He is already gone.”***</u>

<h3>Station 1.0</h3>

A pigeon flew right into my face at the North Station.

On the commuter rail, a guy is throwing pick-up lines at two girls, but ***<u>they are 16!***</u>
“Is that girl your sister? No? Your mother?”

***<u>“I can’t hit on people below 18. Are you 18?” “16.”***</u> “...(shrug)”

<h3>Station 2.0</h3>

A high-school boy wearing a Red Sox jersey is holding a Gatorade bottle that is ***<u>clearly NOT Gatorade.***</u> His drunk stream of consciousness is surprisingly classy:

To a pregnant woman: “Congratulations!”

To the guy on my left: “Yo, dude, where should I get off for Red Sox?” Kenmore. “Thanks man. You’re the best!”

To ***<u>his crew***</u>: “You guys are my people… I choose you guys to talk shit to… Tell me she doesn’t give a fuck… I know she cares, that’s why she did it… Fuck her…”

<h3>My Mentor</h3>

Reverse timeline here, but I officially met my mentor today, a really sweet guy from Ukraine. I was on my way to fill some water, and bumped into him in front of the cubicle.

A warm handshake.

***<u>His voice sounds like blunt sandpaper but soothing like warm coffee.***</u> He is skinnier than I thought, has less hair than I thought (sorry!), but just, surprisingly kind.

From the way he speaks to me, I assume he has a daughter, and he does!

He reminds me of my tennis coaches, both from college and from high school.
