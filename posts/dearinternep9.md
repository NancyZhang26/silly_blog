Dear Jiayi, 

I hope Universal was treating you well. I was at the SSN office this morning and was informed that ***I will get my SSN within 2 weeks.*** Just another 2 weeks till I get paid, Deis. But I genuinely don't mind.

After the first two weeks, ***my team ran out of simple tasks for me.*** TL;DR - they want me to manually test and record ~50 test cases. That is dehumanizing af. I could not. So I initiated that I could build an automation tool. New project at hand -- LFG.

But that was not the point. ***Ever since I got back from New York I have been especially grumpy.*** I hate the office. I hate the job. I hate sitting at a desk facing the wall (just for now). I hate everything. I miss the bus ride, the romance, the thrill, the sweats, the bass. Everything at hand reminds me that I am a normie. I am a NARP.

Is this what life will look like after one goes fully corporate? You sell your soul to your career, and that is all you got. Will this email get traced, and will this email get targeted?

During lunch hours, I was talking to other interns - ***we spend 60-70% of our life in a company. I guess the company should treat you right.*** I think that was a risky statement. The other interns were looking around at another distant colleague who was just munching... I don't think he cares...

This email was drafted a long while ago, and I am finishing it up on a Saturday right now, because I don't want my feelings to just fade away like that, but I guess some of them have already faded.  

I think I am recovering from NY and everything -- GOD! That was a roller coaster. I thought I cannot be hyped anymore, but ***House music was always with me.*** Always. I guess I can't go see John Summit and Mau P and Dom Dolla in Canada in August... But that is for the best no? Can't risk anything about not coming back in.

I was at the Revere Beach with this intern friend Chirag. He just graduated from Masters in NEU. He was such a nice friend. We were drinking and just talking. I think we talked about so many things... He called me an Uber and even called me and left a voice message to make sure I got home safe. What a dude. 

We each had 4-5 shots. Not that much, but enough to get me a bit tipsy. The sun was great. ***My room is full of sand rn,*** lmao...

I am looking forward to the cruise today.

Call me.

Best,
Nancy Zhang
