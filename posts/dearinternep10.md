<h3>Main Plot Starts Here</h3>

Just a compilation of fun moments that deserve a post on their own.

<h3>Presentin to the Senior Director</h3>

As I was bragging about my useless repository called system-test, which is an automated browser test for front-end UI using Typescript, I noticed that Rob was in the fucking G-meet room. Holy lord.  He was nodding and paying attention to my gibberish.

It’s a good thing that I didn’t completely give up on presenting, and that Rob is paying attention, but woah woah woah! ***Attention from the Senior Director?*** Fireworks, champagne! Where are they! Homies, let’s go popping tonight!

<h3>Ticket Skipper?</h3>

On my way back to Malden Center, I usually only buy the train tickets when the train officer checks on me. ***Life hack!*** Please don’t judge me.

This officer walks right in front of me. He asked where I was going. I panicked because he was over 6 feet tall, and I was already free-riding for over 2 stops.

>Malden… Malden Center…

I sound extremely unconfident. Woah!

The officer tapped on my shoe and said:

>You’re all set.

And just like that, ***he exempted my ticket.***

<h3>Jiayi!</h3>

This is not an internship incident, but I might as well include it here.

In a Korean restaurant, Jiayi was looking for one of those raw eggs you use for BBQ sauce. She asked the waiter:

>Emm, do you have… ***Eggs without bacteria?***

***Eggs without bacteria??***

I was holding my laughter like phones in vibration mode. Luckily, the waiters understood her.

<h3>Jiayi! 2.0</h3>

On 7/4, Jiayi and I were in this cute bar playing good, deep House music that gave me shivers. As we were leaving, a muscular man came over:

>Happy 4th!

We had a bit of back-and-forth small talk. He asked:

>What’s in ur drink?

Not interested in furthering this acquaintance, Jiayi said with her chest up:

>***Water — H2O!***

I am not even kidding. She said H, two, “O”, syllable by syllable. This woman really has something.

In the end, the guy left.

<h3>AB! We Don’t Hate You</h3>

Our team leader AB was on vacation. With 1 less person updating our daily progress, the daily standup ended in 21 minutes. Everyone summarized their progress briefly. WIthout AB’s detailed commentary, things went by fast.

>Wow, 21 21-minute standup! ***AB should go on Vacation more often!***

I think it was BK in our team who said that. I mean, you can just say that?

***Is that even sayable?***

<h3>Interns Don’t Deserve A Table</h3>

It was the weekly software group meeting. 20-ish people scattered around the meeting room. The senior directors and elder colleagues sat down around the center table naturally on those comfy couch-like chairs.

I sat down at a seat against the wall. I was not stupid! Interns should know their positions. Not to mention that ***I am the only intern*** among those 30-something adults.

In the recess of the meeting, Mark from another software team turned to me and said:

>Nancy, you’re allowed to sit at the table!

That was a lol moment. I awkwardly answered:

>No, I should leave the table for more professional people.

<h3>My Code Works!</h3>

In another standup, my scripts for automated browser testing were working!

Bill: I love it. This makes me happy.

Hehe. :P

After we were done sharing our coding progress, I told the team that I would be going to El Paso at the end of July. BP, who was from Austin, Texas, said, Ah, El Paso! Right on the border near Mexico. ***It is one of the most dangerous cities in America!***

Bill said:

>Stay safe, Nance. We have invested interest in you!

I was so flattered by this commentary. Invested interest? I should stop touching fish. I really should. Anyways, AI said my previous work = created a ***Role-Based Access Control System.*** Whaaah, I didn’t know putting some v-if in the tags equals building a ***system***? Suddenly, I am kind of proud of myself. It was a cocky moment, and I enjoyed it with a fresh cup of Nespresso coffee. A frog once said that, ***it’s only an unpaid internship if you don’t take enough office supplies.*** Agreed.

<h3>CS Stereotypes?</h3>

The interns were having lunch, and we somehow brought up the stereotypes of CS majors. Shirts? Glasses? Don’t shower often enough? Blah blah blah?

I said, I think people from Brandeis are pretty decent…

Another intern, Liam, chukled out and went:

>No… CS majors in UMass do fit in those stereotypes…

<h3>Munchies</h3>

Why is it that every time I go munching in the lobby, some managers / VPs are present? Why? They were never there when I was fake-grinding, but just there when I was munching like a squirrel. Why??
