<h3>Main Plot Goes Here:</h3>

I’m on the plane. How did 3 weeks in Cali just pass like that?

The radio was playing [“Say You, Say Me”](https://open.spotify.com/track/17CPezzLWzvGfpZW6X8XT0?si=8fa5f8dbe82b452e) on the plane. I felt high. NOOO I was clean, but I guess I was a bit nostalgic, and my mind just tricked me into believing I was somewhere outside of this world.

Everything started rolling up to me, like how I was being a little brat here and there in these 21 years of my life. Turn it off Nancy!! I was staring into the void, jotting down thoughts so I don’t forget things. I won’t forget Jiayi cooking in the most hurry that I have witnessed, sealing her love (cringe!!!) into a container and handing it to me in the car. I ate like a madman.

The crème brûlée from Westfield tastes like sweet paradise.

I was playing loads of [Jay Chou](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2elBjNSdBE2Y3f0j1mjrql?si=M2XzRXrbQjSik6uqNmwx4A) on the car, and they brought me back to the summer of 2018 when I just graduated from Middle School. I really felt like achieving something, but it’s just a graduation ceremony in the Regal Hotel, 10 minutes from my home. It was also called the International Tennis Center. Now the courts were all torn down because the landlord wants a park. My mom helped me with makeup and gave me her necklace. She said, ***<u>“The best makeup is the one that you can’t tell.”***</u>

The lyrics hit me hard. It was pure 2000s aura. I wasn’t even born then. Was I trying to be sophisticated? But the vibes are so simple and dedicated. Not scattering around and trying to be ear catchers. I tried to calm down, but something is always ringing and pinging me.

Jay Chou was so young. His voice was so fresh. It was just some Jay Chou music. Some ballads with the most common chord progressions. They hit me so hard.

***<u>Jiayi told me she was afraid of the highways, but she was cruising faster than ever.***</u>
